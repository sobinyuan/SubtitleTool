["because we lived in South Korea for three years.", "And, the meals were so different from America,", "and distinct,", "and we actually enjoyed them.", "So, now I can't get them the same way.", "So, if you go to a Korean restaurant in America,", "you're going to spend a lot more to get something", "that isn't as probably as quality as what you'd get there.", "Vanessa: It's a different atmosphere,", "all of that.", "Dan: So I had a tough decision to make.", "So, I chose a meal called foreign language 00:27:46", "Vanessa: Okay.", "Dan: Which means three layered flesh in Korean.", "Vanessa: Thick bacon, basically.", "Dan: It's bacon.", "It's thick bacon.", "But, you would cook this on a grill in front of you", "in a restaurant with lots of people", "and you'd hit a little bell and it goes dingdong.", "And then waitress says, foreign language 00:28:05", "And she fills up your water.", "It's more a whole experience than just the food.", "But if Vanessa: If you finish your side dishes,", "they'll bring you endless amounts of other side dishes.", "Dan: Yes.", "Endless side dishes.", "So, it's not really just one thing,", "it's more of the whole experience.", "And it has a lot of nostalgia for us,", "because you can't really get the same thing here.", "You can, but it's just not quite the same.", "Vanessa: Yeah.", "Dan: And it was always delicious,", "especially in South Korea.", "Even us, relatively thin people,", "we lost weight when we went to South Korea,", "because it's just way less rich food in general,", "compared to American diets.", "And, we didn't have very much money,", "so we didn't eat this all the time.", "We just ate it sometimes.", "So, that was always a winner.", "And, I have to add another one,", "because we have traveled in Europe as well.", "And, technically this meal is tastier,", "I'm thinking of...", "Can you guess?", "Vanessa: Cinque Terre.", "Dan: Yep.", "Vanessa: Cinque Terre.", "Dan: Yes.", "There was a seafood meal we ate in Cinque Terre", "that had...", "I don't even remember what we ate,", "fish, pasta.", "Vanessa: I had an octopus.", "Dan: Amazing wine.", "Vanessa: And pasta meat thing.", "Yeah.", "Dan: Yes.",

last little town", "and ate at that restaurant and it was really delicious.", "Vanessa: Yeah.", "Dan: So, it all worked out perfectly.", "Vanessa: Even if we go back there,", "it will be a different vibe and different feel,", "because like you said,", "I think, food is really tied to nostalgia.", "So, the atmosphere and you can't just eat the food", "separately from anything else.", "Dan: Bing bong.", "Vanessa: Yeah.", "We don't have bells on the table to call the waitress.", "Dan: If you're Korean and watching this,", "you're like, What's the big deal about that?", "Vanessa: But for us",

basically on a sidewalk,", "there's little plastic tables and you're cooking this type of thing", "that Dan's talking about.", "But, the one that I thought about", "was also in Korea", "because there's a lot of nostalgia.", "Dan: Is it inaudible 00:30:37", "Vanessa: I almost said inaudible 00:30:39", "Dan: I thought that too.", "Vanessa: I almost said inaudible 00:30:40", "Dan: It's not always the best food,", "but the environment was perfect.", "Vanessa: Yeah.", "But what I said also", "because I like the food so much", "is a meal called dak galbi.", "Dan: Oh.", "Vanessa: And, there was a restaurant", "specifically the restaurant that we went to often in Incheon,", "which was the city we lived in for the first two years in Korea.", "And, our first week living there,", "it was my birthday in September.", "And, we went there with a bunch of new friends.", "And, I had never eaten something like this before,", "where we sat at a table,", "and they had a burner on the table,",

the server was helping to", "Dan: She tossed it up.", "Vanessa: Helping to cook it.", "And we were all just sitting there and watching it.", "It's very different from an American hibachi experience.", "That's a similar experience or similar idea", "where someone is cooking in front of you,", "but this was different,", "much more casual.", "Dan: Yeah.", "Vanessa: And I remember sitting there for my birthday,", "surrounded by all these new friends,", "in a new city,", "eating this food that I thought was so exciting,", "and they're cooking it in front of us.", "And it is amazingly delicious.",

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa  

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,160
from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Today, 
I have a special guest, my husband, Dan. 

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Dan:
Hello. 

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
Vanessa:
Today, we are going to be having a long  

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,560
English conversation, because over two years ago, 
back in February 2020, we made this conversation  

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,520
and millions of you loved this and said that 
it helped you to immerse yourself in English  

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,840
and have a fun time. Today, we are going to be 
doing something similar. We'll be talking about  

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,960
at least 10, possibly more, topics. We'll be 
giving our opinions and stories and ideas. 

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,536
Dan:
Answers. 

10
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,200
Vanessa:
Yes, whatever comes up  

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,600
along the way. There will be subtitles for key 
phrases down here, but you can also click CC to  

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,520
get the full subtitles so that you don't miss any 
words. All right, are you ready to get started? 

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Dan:
I'm ready. 

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Vanessa:
Let's do it.  

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,040
But wait, before we get started, like always, I 
have created a free PDF worksheet for this lesson  

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
that you can download. Never forget what you are 
about to learn. You can click on the link in the  

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,680
description to download this free PDF worksheet 
today, and you will have a chance to answer all  

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,232
of today's questions too.
Dan: 

19
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:21,760
Oo.
Vanessa: 

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,160
Okay. Are you ready for question number one?
Dan: 

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,749
Yes, I'm ready. What is it?
Vanessa: 

22
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:26,720
All right. Question number one ...
Dan: 

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
What is the meaning of life?
Vanessa: 

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,800
Oh, that would be a good start. Topic number one 
is family. I'm going to be putting the timestamps  

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,920
for all of these topics in the description, so if 
you want to rewatch any of these sections you can  

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,480
easily skip to them. My first question is about 
family, and that is what is an interesting fact  

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,800
about your family history?
Dan: 

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,520
Interesting fact. Well, I don't know too much 
about my mom's side of the family. I know they've  

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,440
been in the United States for a long time, but 
they just didn't really keep any records. On my  

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:10,720
dad's side, on the other hand, I have a, well, I 
had a particularly detail-oriented grandmother who  

31
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,680
would remember everything about her childhood. She 
went back and looked at, I don't even know how she  

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,680
found documents about where they came from. Her 
family was in Germany, near, I can't remember,  

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,200
I think it's Hamburg, Hamburg. Grandpa was also 
from somewhere in Germany, and both of them  

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,480
just happened to move to eastern Kansas, which 
is if you've ever been to Kansas, it's just corn  

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
fields and that's it. It's not a very beautiful 
place, but somehow they ended up in Kansas. 

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,320
Dan:
My grandma would always give lots of details  

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,640
about growing up there on the farm and how they 
didn't have electricity. She would go on about  

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,560
these stories about, this is how she would 
talk, one time, me and my brother Bern,  

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,320
we went to the backyard and filled up 
the tin bucket with hot boiling water,  

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,720
and he took all the hot water, Daniel.
Vanessa: 

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
She remembered it was a tin bucket.
Dan: 

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Yeah, and it was cousin Bern, and it 
was Uncle Freddie, people like that.  

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think her father's name was Freddie.
Vanessa: 

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Oh, that's her son's name.
Dan: 

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
Yeah. I don't know how interesting 
that is, but it's the only  

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,120
cultural knowledge I have about my past. The 
other side of the family, they just, we lived  

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,640
in Virginia a long time ago, and my great 
grandfather was a coal miner apparently so  

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,000
kind of interesting, I guess.
Vanessa: 

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Yeah. I think that's pretty cool though that 
because in the US everyone has heritage from  

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
other places around the world and it gets lost 
sometimes. In fact, that's what I was going to  

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,160
talk about too in a moment. That area in Kansas, 
I remember your grandma saying that there were  

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
German-only churches.
Dan: 

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,360
Oh yeah.
Vanessa: 

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,800
So they would speak only German. 
Did your grandma know any German? 

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Dan:
Very little. I don't think she knew a lot. 

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
Vanessa:
I think that's kind of the generational thing,  

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,331
like her parents knew it.
Dan: 

58
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:20,399
She's probably the last generation that spoke 
German, or her parents were the last generation  

59
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,439
that spoke German.
Vanessa: 

60
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, but then for her she just understood 
probably some German. That community was,  

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
for some reason, where lots of German people 
moved to and that's where your family's from. 

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
Dan:
Yeah. They went through a lot of  

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,160
really challenging cultural changes. There was a 
lot of German mistrust and hate during that time,  

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
obviously, for reasons that we can understand.
Vanessa: 

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,824
Political reasons.
Dan: 

66
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:51,920
We were at war with Germany a lot, so I think 
they were trying to scrub out a lot of the super  

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,880
German sounding things. Apparently our last 
name was more German sounding at one point.  

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't know how they said it, and speaking 
German would certainly be one of those things. 

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Vanessa:
Yeah, so they tried to assimilate to  

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
life and that's similar to my ...
Dan: 

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,640
Tell me about your family history.
Vanessa: 

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,800
...similar to the interesting point I wanted 
to tell you about. My family history is that  

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,280
on my dad's side, my great 
grandma and my great grandpa, they  

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,520
are from around the area of Naples, Italy. 
First, my great grandpa went on a boat,  

75
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
came to the US, married someone, had three kids.
Dan: 

76
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
It was a good story.
Vanessa: 

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Then his wife died.
Dan: 

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,968
Oh, that's the bad part.
Vanessa: 

79
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:40,080
He had three kids and no wife and he's working, 
I'm sure, a really difficult job. That was not a  

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
time when you could be a single father.
Dan: 

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
This was in Pittsburgh, right?
Vanessa: 

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,360
They were either in New York or Pittsburgh, 
but by the time my great grandma came, they  

83
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,000
went to Pittsburgh. We're getting a little ahead 
of ourselves. He wrote a letter to his mother who  

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,720
lived back in Italy, and he said, I need to find 
a new wife. Can you help me to find a new wife  

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,840
from our hometown that will come here to live 
with me and help take care of my three kids.  

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,320
His mom said, no problem. I'll find you a wife. I 
got her. Here's her height. Here's her dimensions.  

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Get a wedding dress for her. My great grandpa got 
a wedding dress made in the US, the right size and  

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,760
everything for his future mysterious wife. We call 
this a mail order bride. He basically ordered her  

89
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,440
in a letter like you would a package.
Vanessa: 

90
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,080
I don't know what he did with his kids, 
but he went to Italy, and as legend has it,  

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,920
one day he was in the house. They 
were preparing things for the wedding,  

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,960
and he looked out the window and a woman walked 
by, and he said, oh, that's the woman I want  

93
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,493
to marry.
Dan: 

94
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:52,160
Who is that?
Vanessa: 

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,640
Was that his mail order bride? 
Nope, that was my great-grandmother. 

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,155
Dan:
Was it her sister? The original woman's sister? 

97
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,360
Vanessa:
One of the legends is that  

98
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,200
it was his, well not his sister ...
Dan: 

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
Adds to the drama.
Vanessa: 

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,680
But my grandma clarified. This was her mother. 
She said, oh, he saw her outside the window. 

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Dan:
Just a random lady? 

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Vanessa:
Uh-huh. Well, this is all a little vague  

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,320
because this is going back quite some time.
Dan: 

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,400
Excuse me, ma'am? Will you marry me??
Vanessa: 

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:30,240
Basically. She was taller than his other 
supposed to be wife. He married her. Her name  

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,320
was Antoinette. He married her. She said, yes, I'm 
going to move to the US with you, leave my family.  

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,720
She must have had a really tough situation, I 
imagine. They were all farmers. I'm sure that  

108
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,880
was a really hard life, and that could give her 
some hope for the future. In the wedding pictures,  

109
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,360
her dress is a little bit too short because 
it was not supposed to be her dress. It was  

110
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
supposed to be the other lady's dress. 
I'm glad that happened because otherwise  

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,760
I would not be here.
Dan: 

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,840
That's Vanessa's origin story, really.
Vanessa: 

113
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah. This lady, Antoinette, she moved to the 
US. She had three kids and then her husband died,  

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,520
so she had six children in a new country. Crazy 
story. She raised them. She's what we might call  

115
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
the matriarch of my dad's side of the family.
Dan: 

116
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Antoinette Manolfi.
Vanessa: 

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,800
Everybody who is from that side of the 
family knows her and reveres her. Oh,  

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,960
she was so amazing. Oh yeah, she just helped 
us survive. We might say she was a survivor.  

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,520
She really went through a lot, and she 
was the right person for the job because  

120
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,453
she made it work.
Dan: 

121
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:38,799
Nice.
Vanessa: 

122
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
Yeah. That's an interesting story about 
my family. I'm sure everyone has those  

123
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,840
as well. I want to ask you the same 
question. Let us know in the comments,  

124
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,000
what's an interesting story or an interesting 
fact about your family history. We'd love to know.  

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,120
Let's go to question number two. This is about 
childhood. I'd like to know what's something that  

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,200
you did as a child that you still do now. These 
are kind of personal questions to start off with. 

127
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Dan:
Well, we laughed before  

128
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:14,800
this because she said everything. I am a little 
bit, let's just say, youthful in my approach  

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,840
to life. That's the positive way to say it anyway. 
Something that I directly do, especially now,  

130
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,000
because I have kids, is catching critters.
Vanessa: 

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Oh yeah.
Dan: 

132
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Catching critters and keeping them. I would 
say critters are generally small animals.  

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,600
When I was a kid, I spent, I would say 50% 
of my life trying to catch frogs, lizards,  

134
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,680
grasshoppers, snakes, bugs of any 
kind, and I would keep them in cages.  

135
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,800
I would use nets to catch butterflies, terrariums, 
aquariums, fish, anything like that. I caught and  

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,600
kept lots and lots of critters. There was probably 
a five-year phase where we didn't do that very  

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,400
much. Funnily enough, even when we first got 
married, and you're into this too, I don't know  

138
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,800
where she got this. Maybe it's infectious.
Vanessa: 

139
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
We caught tad poles as kids.
Dan: 

140
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,840
We would catch tad poles as just a married 
couple. We'd go down to the pond and scoop  

141
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,880
in and get some mucky, gucky tad poles and watch 
them change into frogs. It's the miracle of life. 

142
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,920
Vanessa:
You know what? I have a  

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:38,320
distinct memory on our honeymoon, we were taking a 
hike, and you saw, I think this was the first time  

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,297
I'd ever caught critters with you because, 
I don't know, maybe when we were dating ... 

145
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:43,840
Dan:
She didn't know what she was signing up for. 

146
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Vanessa:
Maybe when we were dating, we just  

147
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,240
weren't in those situations. I remember we were on 
a hike and you were in a stream picking up rocks,  

148
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,440
and you were so excited. This is a good salamander 
spot. There might be salamanders. Then you found  

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,080
one and I was so impressed.
Dan: 

150
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Vanessa: 

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,760
How did you find that salamander because I caught 
tad poles maybe like every summer as a kid,  

152
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,880
but I never caught salamanders or whole frogs or 
fish. We had nets and caught fireflies and stuff,  

153
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,520
but I think you take it to the next level.
Dan: 

154
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Yeah. Especially as a kid, I took it to 
the next level. One time I caught a five  

155
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,400
foot snake. I didn't even know what kind 
it was, I just reached into the bushes.  

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,240
I didn't grab it the right way. I was like 
swinging it through the air. That was probably  

157
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,560
the dumbest thing I ever did honestly catching 
critters as a child. It extends beyond that too.  

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,320
I've always liked keeping fish. I love making fish 
tanks and the environments. Obviously you can do  

159
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,920
that for frogs and reptiles. I have big dreams 
for my son because he's also very into this. 

160
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,480
Vanessa:
Oh yeah.  

161
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,320
He is crazed about his net and catching stuff. He 
just loves that. I mean it's treasures in nature. 

162
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Dan:
Soon enough,  

163
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
our house will turn into a menagerie of critters.
Vanessa: 

164
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,640
I just have one rule. I would ...
Dan: 

165
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,360
Scorpions.
Vanessa: 

166
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
I don't mind keeping frogs and lizards and fish.
Dan: 

167
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,000
Snakes?
Vanessa: 

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
But I don't want to keep any snakes.
Dan: 

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh, come on.
Vanessa: 

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,520
I know a lot of snakes are harmless ...
Dan: 

171
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,240
They're cute.
Vanessa: 

172
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,320
... but I would rather the snakes live 
under our shed than live in our house. 

173
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
Dan:
That's more dangerous. 

174
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
Vanessa:
Well, if they're not poisonous.  

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,600
If they're not venomous, then they can catch 
rats and catch things and keep our chicken safe,  

176
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
that type of thing.
Dan: 

177
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
That's what snakes do?
Vanessa: 

178
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,800
Yeah. A lot of chickens ...
Dan: 

179
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,160
They protect chickens.
Vanessa: 

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,514
Yeah. A lot of people, and this 
is getting a little deep ... 

181
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,440
Dan:
Are chickens critters? 

182
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,840
Vanessa:
I don't  

183
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,800
this so. When I think of a critter, I think of 
crawling, like something that goes like k-k-k-k,  

184
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
like a little crawly thing.
Dan: 

185
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
Am I a critter?
Vanessa: 

186
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,240
That's a good question. I was going to say some 
people, we have chickens, you might have seen  

187
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,720
this on our YouTube channel before, some people 
purposefully have a rat snake or a black snake,  

188
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,240
a garter snake that lives in their chicken 
coop, and they eat like one egg per  

189
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,806
two weeks or something. They don't eat that much.
Dan: 

190
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:17,280
Is that good?
Vanessa: 

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,880
They do it for protection. They're keeping rats 
away. They're keeping other things away from the  

192
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
coop. There's a whole, let me tell you ...
Dan: 

193
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,240
You want me to bring snakes into 
our family, well, but outside? 

194
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
Vanessa:
As long as they are outside,  

195
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,640
that's okay. I don't want snakes in my house.
Dan: 

196
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,880
I have lots of good stories about snakes in 
the house. One snake escaped in the house. 

197
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,800
Vanessa:
Oh, don't tell me that. 

198
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
Dan:
My mom found it under the couch months later  

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
and it was dead.
Vanessa: 

200
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,200
Oh no. Yeah.
Dan: 

201
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,200
It was one of those classic situations of 
mom screams in the other room, and we're  

202
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
like what? What?
Vanessa: 

203
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,120
You kids have that snake in here? 

204
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,080
Dan:
Daniel,  

205
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
gee, what is this thing? That's what she'd say.
Vanessa: 

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Well, do you want to share also while we're 
on this topic, your first memory, the frog? 

207
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
Dan:
Oh my very first memory. 

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Vanessa:
Yes. This will drill in the point that Dan  

209
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
loves critters.
Dan: 

210
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,640
Yeah. I caught a toad probably when I was 
two years old and I was, for some reason,  

211
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,480
holding it off my deck and I dropped it down into 
the bushes. I remember thinking, no, my toad. Then  

212
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
I went down to look for it and I couldn't find it.
Vanessa: 

213
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,864
This is Dan's first memory in life.
Dan: 

214
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah, literally one, at least as far as I know.
Vanessa: 

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
Well, there you go.
Dan: 

216
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah. That's the point of it?
Vanessa: 

217
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,594
A lifetime of catching critters started 
at a young age. Well, I think ... 

218
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,280
Dan:
Yeah. How about you? 

219
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,920
Vanessa:
For me? 

220
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
Dan:
What do you still do besides catching  

221
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,520
lots of critters?
Vanessa: 

222
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,960
I do catch tad poles still. That's fun. I 
think the thing that first came to my mind,  

223
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,600
and I tried to think about just like the first 
thing that came to my mind for each of these, is  

224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,440
when I was a kid I loved to dig in the dirt. 
My sister and I had two best friends who lived  

225
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,040
right across the street, and we spent hours in 
the backyard just digging in the dirt. We built  

226
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,000
things in the dirt. We had little inventions. We 
made homes in the dirt. We did so many things.  

227
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Now I dig in the dirt, but I call it gardening.
Dan: 

228
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
I think we have the wrong YouTube channel. 
We just need to be covered in mud with like  

229
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
snakes and gardening.
Vanessa: 

230
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
Maybe that will be YouTube channel ...
Dan: 

231
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,880
Number two.
Vanessa: 

232
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,040
Number two, Dan catches critters and 
Vanessa digs in the dirt and gardens.  

233
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,280
I remember when I was in seventh grade at school, 
we had a class, I think it was Home Ec., which  

234
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,280
is like home economics. You learn about cooking, 
and sewing, and those types of things. There was  

235
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,880
a hygiene section where you learned how to take 
care of your hair, how to take care of your nails.  

236
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
I remember specifically ...
Dan: 

237
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
How to take care of your nails?
Vanessa: 

238
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,160
I know.
Dan: 

239
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
There's a class about that?
Vanessa: 

240
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
Well, it was like how to, I don't know, some 
people maybe don't learn that at home, like how  

241
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,680
to trim your nails and stuff. This lady was one 
of those people that as a middle schooler, most  

242
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
middle schoolers just roll their eyes at, like, 
oh, you think I'm going to do that? Oh, I'm not  

243
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:17,040
going to be like you, but she was our teacher. She 
was telling us how to clean our nails and paint  

244
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
them in this type of thing. I remember asking ...
Dan: 

245
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Was it for ladies only?
Vanessa: 

246
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Yeah, we were split by gender, so there was boys 
in one class, girls in the other just for Home  

247
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,360
Ec. I remember her saying how to clean 
your nails and make them look nice. I  

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,680
remember asking in the class, I said, but 
what if I always have dirt under my nails? 

249
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Dan:
You raised your hands and asked that? 

250
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,200
Vanessa:
I asked that question. I was so  

251
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:51,040
naive. I always have dirt under my nails. I can't 
get them clean like that. She looked at me like,  

252
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,320
what? Like I had three heads on my head. What? 
Why would you have dirt under your nails? You're  

253
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,960
a seventh grade girl. I think after that ...
Dan: 

254
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,867
Be proper.
Vanessa: 

255
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:07,680
... maybe when I was in eighth grade or so I 
had a phase where I stopped playing in the dirt  

256
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,999
and did other things. Now I have come full 
circle and well, I took a shower recently,  

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,640
so my nails are actually clean, but they're 
almost always full of dirt. Just like our kids. 

258
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Dan:
I'm sure you put in more  

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,400
effort to get the dirt out now.
Vanessa: 

260
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,359
Yeah. Kind of. Sometimes it works, sometimes 
it doesn't, but I have the same mindset as a  

261
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,720
seventh grader of, well, my hands aren't 
going to be completely clean because ... 

262
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Dan:
You really do. 

263
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,040
Vanessa:
... I was just playing in the dirt.  

264
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,880
What's the matter with that?
Dan: 

265
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
If you look at Vanessa's wardrobe, 
I have more clothes than her  

266
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,280
half the time.
Vanessa: 

267
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
I don't really care about those kind of things.
Dan: 

268
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah. She's not you're a typical girly 
girl. Let's put it that way. A girly girl. 

269
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,480
Vanessa:
That's okay. 

270
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Dan:
That's my sister.  

271
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
Maybe we'll talk about her later.
Vanessa: 

272
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,680
Okay. All right. Well, let's go to our next 
question. But before we do that, I want to ask  

273
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,120
you, what is something that you did in childhood 
that you still do now? Let us know in the  

274
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,560
comments. All right. Let's go to question number 
three. Question number three is about hobbies.  

275
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,320
I'd like to know if you could wake up tomorrow 
and magically have any kind of education,  

276
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,240
talent, or skill set, what would it be?
Dan: 

277
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
Education or skill?
Vanessa: 

278
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
Yeah, this is very broad.
Dan: 

279
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Yes. Well, when I think skill, I mean, I 
think that I would want to be, and this is  

280
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:32,320
a little stereotypical, an athlete of some kind, 
particularly a hockey player. When you are playing  

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,880
a sport and you really like that sport, you get 
into the flow and you just live in that moment  

282
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,960
and you just have so much fun. I can remember 
as a kid, one time I scored a goal to win the  

283
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,760
game in hockey, and that's just the greatest 
feeling ever. Now, if you add to that, a big  

284
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,840
stadium full of fans cheering your name ... Am I 
egotistical? I don't know. That would just be the  

285
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,280
ultimate thrill to score a goal and hear everybody 
cheering. I would say, yeah, either an athlete of  

286
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:16,720
some kind or a performer. I think you get the same 
kind of feeling if you are acting, if you're maybe  

287
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,640
a standup comedian and you're making people laugh.
Dan: 

288
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Even to a certain degree, I think 
being a really great teacher,  

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,640
being a really great teacher probably gives you 
that same kind of feeling of you're performing  

290
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:42,080
and bringing value and people are entertained. 
If I were to have like, I wasn't thinking so much  

291
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,600
education, I was thinking more skills, so I would 
wake up tomorrow and I'd be the best hockey player  

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,160
on earth.
Vanessa: 

293
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,880
Wow.
Dan: 

294
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,160
Maybe that'd be a little bit boring 
just beating everybody right and left.  

295
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm sure you still have to work though. 
Yeah, I'd have great athletic prowess. 

296
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,040
Vanessa:
Cool. 

297
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,960
Dan:
How about you? What would you  

298
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
want to wake up tomorrow with?
Vanessa: 

299
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
Well, I said something a little bit stereotypical 
too. I had my primary answer and then  

300
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,520
a maybe cheat answer. I think if I 
could wake up tomorrow with a skill,  

301
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,480
maybe I said something a little more realistic. 
I said, I'd like to be able to play the ukulele  

302
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
really well.
Dan: 

303
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
The ukulele?
Vanessa: 

304
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,280
I don't play the ukulele. I play the flute. I 
don't know. I just thought if I could have a  

305
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,320
cool skill, I mean, that's something that I could 
take outside. I could be playing while the kids  

306
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,880
are playing.
Dan: 

307
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
This is a very humble dream.
Vanessa: 

308
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,560
Maybe it is. I didn't want to think for 
too long about this. I wanted to give you  

309
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,480
my initial response. Yeah, I think it would be 
cool. A guitar is pretty big to take somewhere.  

310
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,560
A piano would be amazing, but it's not quite as 
portable. I just feel like sometimes when you're,  

311
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,440
I had this image, like you're sitting around 
a bonfire and the sun setting and you're just  

312
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,360
chatting with your friends, just having a ukulele 
and playing some music, oh, that just brings the  

313
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
atmosphere to a very warm place.
Dan: 

314
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,040
You could play Wheels On the Bus for our children.
Vanessa: 

315
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
I could maybe play Wheels 
On the Bus in five minutes. 

316
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,600
Dan:
That's the first song that comes to my  

317
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,320
head. The version we listen to, It's like 
do, do, do, do, and I just hear ukulele. 

318
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
Vanessa:
Yeah. Well, if you  

319
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,040
play the ukulele and you have any recommendations, 
let me know in the comments, but my cheat answer,  

320
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,680
because I wasn't sure if it was a skillset or a 
character trait, but I said unlimited patience.  

321
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
If I could wake up in the morning ...
Dan: 

322
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,467
That's an education.
Vanessa: 

323
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:44,240
... and oh, I guess you can learn patience. If I 
could have unlimited patience with my children,  

324
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
that would be amazing, and with myself.
Dan: 

325
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,560
They'd get away with you too much though.
Vanessa: 

326
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,040
I don't know. I think you can be firm and also be 
patient. It doesn't mean you have no standards,  

327
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,800
but I think that I would, yeah, just be able to 
be a little bit, I think you're always a better  

328
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,360
parent when you are more patient.
Dan: 

329
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
They certainly test the patience.
Vanessa: 

330
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Yes. Unlimited patience would be awesome. What 
about you? If you could wake up tomorrow and have  

331
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,480
any education, talent, or skill set, what would 
it be? Would it be speaking English fluently,  

332
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,080
or maybe it would be something else. Let us know 
in the comments. Let's go to question number four.  

333
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,640
Question number four is about travel. I'd like 
to know where is the next place in the US that  

334
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,560
you'd like to visit?
Dan: 

335
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,800
Oh, I've got to travel in the US?
Vanessa: 

336
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,760
Yeah. I wanted it to be a little more 
specific and it might be interesting to  

337
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,800
some of our international students 
to learn about places in the US. 

338
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,760
Dan:
I'm joking because there are a lot of amazing  

339
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:52,080
places in the US, but I really love international 
cities like Europe and Asia. I just think they're  

340
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,880
so interesting.
Vanessa: 

341
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,600
I know.
Dan: 

342
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:02,880
But the US has lots of beautiful natural 
environments, so I would probably travel  

343
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,760
to Washington or Oregon.
Vanessa: 

344
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,720
You know what?
Dan: 

345
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
You'd say the same thing.
Vanessa: 

346
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,200
My first answer was the northwest, Seattle, 
that area, Oregon, and I crossed it off. 

347
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Dan:
Did you think that I was going to say that? 

348
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Vanessa:
No, I thought of somewhere  

349
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
I would rather visit first.
Dan: 

350
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,160
Oh, I'm with you. Okay.
Vanessa: 

351
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,000
I'd like to go there too.
Dan: 

352
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah. The Pacific northwest because I've never 
been there and it just looks so stunningly  

353
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,880
beautiful there, at least for part of the year. 
It has really big mountains and really dense green  

354
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:41,600
forests, and it has the ocean as well. I really 
love a landscape that has lots of rocky features,  

355
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:49,440
but also the ocean. That's one of my favorite 
kinds of landscapes. I would probably go there,  

356
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,400
and it has really cool cities too. Seattle is 
a really awesome city and you could jump up,  

357
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
I mean I've never been there, but it looks really 
cool, and you can jump up to Vancouver as well  

358
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,760
and get that full Pacific northwest experience. 
That's where I would choose. I could do lots of  

359
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,200
outdoorsy stuff. I could see a different side of 
the country and even do some urban things as well. 

360
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
Vanessa:
Yeah. That sounds like a fun place. In fact,  

361
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520
one of my options too.
Dan: 

362
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Yeah. What did you choose instead?
Vanessa: 

363
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
Well, I thought about that.
Dan: 

364
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,840
Wait, let me guess. Grand Canyon.
Vanessa: 

365
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
Close.
Dan: 

366
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,160
New Mexico.
Vanessa: 

367
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,760
A little more general.
Dan: 

368
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
Arizona.
Vanessa: 

369
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:38,960
I said I want to rent an RV and have a big 
tour of the west, southwest, national parks. 

370
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
Dan:
Oh this is a regional thing. 

371
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
Vanessa:
Yeah, because there's so many  

372
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
amazing national parks in the west, southwest, 
not even southwest, but just the west of the US.  

373
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,240
I think that would be an awesome two month journey 
where you say I'm going to book a bunch of camping  

374
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
places and you're not having to like tent camp. 
I think that might be a little too intense for us  

375
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,530
for two months, but in an RV with ...
Vanessa: 

376
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,840
... Were intense for us for two months. But, 
in an RV, it would still be in cool locations,  

377
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,240
maybe closer to the national parks, 
and you get to see a lot. Because,  

378
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,840
two months ago, we went to Colorado, 
in Colorado Springs and I'd never seen  

379
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,000
the Rocky Mountains or that area of the U.S. 
And I was blown away. It is so beautiful. Yeah,  

380
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,440
I've been reading some books about that area 
of the U.S., and historical fiction about the  

381
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,920
history there. And yeah, I'm fascinated. I think 
that would be really cool to check out some of  

382
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,720
the history, check out some beautiful places. 
We like hiking, so it seems like a good fit. 

383
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,840
Dan:
Yeah. And it's very different  

384
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,360
from where we live now.
Vanessa: 

385
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,920
Yeah. Surprisingly, so.
Dan: 

386
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,960
Yeah. So, I chose the wettest part of 
the country and you chose the driest. 

387
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
Vanessa:
Yeah. Yeah. I think  

388
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,640
that was really shocking to me, when we 
went to Colorado. It's super dry there.  

389
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,560
And I've been in dry climates before-
Dan: 

390
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
And, Arizona is way drier.
Vanessa: 

391
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,341
... Oh, I bet. Yeah, there's deserts there.
Dan: 

392
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:04,720
Mm-hmm.
Vanessa: 

393
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,840
But I feel like, being somewhere 
like that, even though the U.S.  

394
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,480
is the same country, it feels so different, 
that it does feel like you've gone almost into  

395
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,897
a different world when you visit different 
climates like that and different geography. 

396
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:22,800
Dan:
It is very  

397
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,560
easily could be many countries.
Vanessa: 

398
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, it could very easily be.
Dan: 

399
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Maybe it should be.
Vanessa: 

400
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,240
Many countries. So, I want to know for you, if 
you live in the U.S. or if you got the chance to  

401
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,240
visit the U.S., where would you like to visit? 
Where's the first place that you would like to go  

402
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,040
if you got to come to the U.S.? Let us know in the 
comments. And, let's go to question number four. I  

403
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,952
actually meant question number five.
Dan: 

404
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:45,520
Whoops.
Vanessa: 

405
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,580
So question number five, the topic is food.
Dan: 

406
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,360
Yes.
Vanessa: 

407
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Something that we love. I would 
like to know what is a food from  

408
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,920
your travels, our travels, that 
you wish you could have again? 

409
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,800
Dan:
Man, this is the hardest question,  

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:09,360
because we've had so many delicious meals in our 
travels. And we just love different food as well. 

411
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,911
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

412
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,200
Dan:
And this is very tied up in nostalgia for me too,  

413
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,400
because we lived in South Korea for three years. 
And, the meals were so different from America,  

414
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:27,600
and distinct, and we actually enjoyed them. So, 
now I can't get them the same way. So, if you  

415
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,720
go to a Korean restaurant in America, you're going 
to spend a lot more to get something that isn't as  

416
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,573
probably as quality as what you'd get there.
Vanessa: 

417
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,920
It's a different atmosphere, all of that.
Dan: 

418
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,520
So I had a tough decision to make. So, I chose 
a meal called [foreign language 00:27:46]. 

419
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,840
Vanessa:
Okay. 

420
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,960
Dan:
Which means three layered flesh in Korean. 

421
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,560
Vanessa:
Thick bacon, basically. 

422
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,160
Dan:
It's bacon. It's thick bacon. But,  

423
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,160
you would cook this on a grill in front of you 
in a restaurant with lots of people and you'd  

424
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,360
hit a little bell and it goes dingdong. And then 
waitress says, " [foreign language 00:28:05]." And  

425
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,822
she fills up your water. It's more a whole 
experience than just the food. But if- 

426
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,960
Vanessa:
If you finish your side dishes, they'll bring you  

427
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,560
endless amounts of other side dishes.
Dan: 

428
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:22,240
... Yes. Endless side dishes. So, it's not really 
just one thing, it's more of the whole experience.  

429
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,400
And it has a lot of nostalgia for us, because you 
can't really get the same thing here. You can,  

430
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,720
but it's just not quite the same.
Vanessa: 

431
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:30,960
Yeah.
Dan: 

432
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,400
And it was always delicious, especially in 
South Korea. Even us, relatively thin people,  

433
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,240
we lost weight when we went to South Korea, 
because it's just way less rich food in general,  

434
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,240
compared to American diets. And, we didn't have 
very much money, so we didn't eat this all the  

435
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,760
time. We just ate it sometimes. So, that was 
always a winner. And, I have to add another one,  

436
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,000
because we have traveled in Europe as well. 
And, technically this meal is tastier,  

437
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,853
I'm thinking of... Can you guess?
Vanessa: 

438
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:07,440
Cinque Terre.
Dan: 

439
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,341
Yep.
Vanessa: 

440
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:09,746
Cinque Terre.
Dan: 

441
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:17,680
Yes. There was a seafood meal we ate in Cinque 
Terre that had... I don't even remember what we  

442
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,360
ate, fish, pasta.
Vanessa: 

443
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,960
I had a octopus.
Dan: 

444
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,267
Amazing wine.
Vanessa: 

445
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,000
And pasta meat thing. Yeah.
Dan: 

446
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,320
Yes.
Vanessa: 

447
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,960
Crazy.
Dan: 

448
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,360
And, that was also a good vibe. Nostalgic 
experience. Because, when I think back to it, we  

449
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,520
did a lot of beautiful hikes on that trip. And 
then, we ended in the last little town and ate at  

450
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
that restaurant and it was really delicious.
Vanessa: 

451
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,920
Yeah.
Dan: 

452
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,080
So, it all worked out perfectly.
Vanessa: 

453
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,120
Even if we go back there, it will be a different 
vibe and different feel, because like you said,  

454
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,200
I think, food is really tied to nostalgia. So, 
the atmosphere and you can't just eat the food  

455
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,840
separately from anything else.
Dan: 

456
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,720
Bing bong.
Vanessa: 

457
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah. We don't have bells on 
the table to call the waitress. 

458
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Dan:
If you're Korean and watching this,  

459
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
you're like, "What's the big deal about that?"
Vanessa: 

460
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
But for us-
Dan: 

461
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,040
But for us, it's just so, "This is so funny and-" 

462
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Vanessa:
... It was so great. And yeah,  

463
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
we love that experience.
Dan: 

464
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,040
... Yes.
Vanessa: 

465
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,784
Mine is-
Dan: 

466
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:12,880
So how about you? Yes.
Vanessa: 

467
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
... Very similar. In fact, yeah-
Dan: 

468
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,707
Was it the same meal?
Vanessa: 

469
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:22,880
... No, I thought about saying, not specifically 
some [inaudible 00:30:22], but just eating  

470
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,520
outside. It's basically on a sidewalk, there's 
little plastic tables and you're cooking this  

471
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,080
type of thing that Dan's talking about. But, the 
one that I thought about was also in Korea because  

472
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
there's a lot of nostalgia.
Dan: 

473
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,080
Is it [inaudible 00:30:37]?
Vanessa: 

474
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,854
I almost said [inaudible 00:30:39].
Dan: 

475
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:39,881
I thought that too.
Vanessa: 

476
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:39,920
I almost said [inaudible 00:30:40].
Dan: 

477
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,120
It's not always the best food, 
but the environment was perfect. 

478
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,040
Vanessa:
Yeah. But what I said also because I like  

479
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,171
the food so much is a meal called dak-galbi.
Dan: 

480
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:48,640
Oh.
Vanessa: 

481
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,080
And, there was a restaurant specifically the 
restaurant that we went to often in Incheon, which  

482
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,240
was the city we lived in for the first two years 
in Korea. And, our first week living there, it was  

483
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,520
my birthday in September. And, we went there 
with a bunch of new friends. And, I had never  

484
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,840
eaten something like this before, where we sat 
at a table, and they had a burner on the table,  

485
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,040
and they had all the ingredients 
there, and it was uncooked chicken,  

486
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,440
cabbage, rice cakes, all of these things, 
carrots, the sauce. It was all in this thing. And,  

487
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,400
the person who was the server was helping to-
Dan: 

488
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,053
She tossed it up.
Vanessa: 

489
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,040
... Helping to cook it. And we were 
all just sitting there and watching  

490
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,880
it. It's very different from an American 
hibachi experience. That's a similar  

491
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,920
experience or similar idea where someone is 
cooking in front of you, but this was different,  

492
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,120
much more casual.
Dan: 

493
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,600
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

494
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,960
And I remember sitting there for my 
birthday, surrounded by all these  

495
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,320
new friends, in a new city, eating this food that 
I thought was so exciting, and they're cooking it  

496
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,918
in front of us. And it is amazingly delicious.
Dan: 

497
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:55,920
Mm-hmm. It was very yummy.
Vanessa: 

498
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,960
And, that place is, yeah, full of so many 
memories. So, whenever someone came to visit us  

499
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,680
from the U.S., or we made a new friend, we would 
always go to that restaurant. And then, the third  

500
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,080
year we lived in South Korea, we moved to a 
city called Suan, which is about an hour away.  

501
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,848
And, after that year, that restaurant closed. No.
Dan: 

502
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,080
No.
Vanessa: 

503
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,920
So, when this question says, something 
you wish you could try again,  

504
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,160
this will always be just a wish.
Dan: 

505
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm sure that lady opened up 
another restaurant, right? 

506
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,440
Vanessa:
I hope so. I  

507
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,560
hope she is world renowned as amazing dak-galbi 
restaurant, because we had dak-galbi also in Suan,  

508
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,960
and that was nice. That lady was super nice. 
We talked through Google translate a lot. 

509
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
Dan:
Yeah. Their dak-galbi was good too. 

510
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,720
Vanessa:
Yeah, but there something about  

511
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,400
that first place that really-
Dan: 

512
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,387
It had the nostalgia.
Vanessa: 

513
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:47,760
... It has a special place in my 
heart. So, that's what I would say. 

514
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,480
Dan:
It is funny though,  

515
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,240
we would take Korean people there and 
they'd be like, "Yeah, it's pretty good." 

516
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
Vanessa:
But for us, that was- 

517
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,280
Dan:
We're like, "This is so awesome." 

518
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,120
Vanessa:
... So fun. Yeah. Anyway, you can see,  

519
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,800
we get very excited about food. Now, maybe I know 
why our children are also excited about food.  

520
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
They're crazed about food, so.
Dan: 

521
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
It's because their kids.
Vanessa: 

522
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,240
Yeah. But some kids are very picky.
Dan: 

523
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,621
Well, that's true. Yeah, they do 
like more food than average kids. 

524
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,959
Vanessa:
Our kids love all this type of stuff  

525
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,360
just as passionately as us. All right. So I have a 
question for you. What is a food from your travels  

526
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,920
that you wish you could have again? It might be 
because it was good. It might be because of the  

527
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,120
vibe, and the atmosphere, and the memories, the 
nostalgia, like what we talked about. Let us know  

528
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,200
in the comments what food you wish you could have 
again, and we'll learn about food from around the  

529
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,040
world. All right, let's go to the next question, 
question number six. I think we're on six. 

530
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,082
Dan:
Yeah. 

531
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:40,240
Vanessa:
All right, question number six.  

532
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,200
Question number six is about nature. This 
is maybe a little silly of a question,  

533
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
but that's okay.
Dan: 

534
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,440
We like critters, so that's okay.
Vanessa: 

535
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah, as you can tell. So, this question is, if 
you could have any defense mechanism of an animal,  

536
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,720
what would you have? So if you could 
have that type of defense mechanism  

537
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
in your body or become you-
Dan: 

538
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,836
In my body.
Vanessa: 

539
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:09,440
... Yes. What would it be? So can we maybe 
explain quickly what a defense mechanism is? 

540
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
Dan:
Yeah, sure. So, a  

541
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:17,839
defense mechanism is something that an animal has 
or uses a feature that protects it from predators. 

542
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,320
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

543
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,760
Dan:
Or is a way to either get the predator  

544
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,920
to go away or escape the predator.
Vanessa: 

545
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,080
So maybe quills on a porcupine, something like 
this. And we can even say humans have a defense  

546
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,719
mechanism. We might use that emotionally.
Dan: 

547
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,439
Oh yeah.
Vanessa: 

548
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,960
To say, "Oh, why is he always making jokes?" 
It's actually a defense mechanism because  

549
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,840
he experienced a lot of trauma in his 
life, and joking, and laughing helps him to  

550
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,954
not feel so vulnerable.
Dan: 

551
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:51,199
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

552
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,319
Or something like this. It's a more of an 
emotional thing. So you can have a defense  

553
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,240
mechanism as a human, but I want to know, in a 
silly way, if you could imagine having an animal's  

554
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,440
defense mechanism, what would it be?
Dan: 

555
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,840
Mine would be... This is 
a little bit of a cop out. 

556
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,560
Vanessa:
Okay. 

557
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,520
Dan:
Flying. 

558
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,165
Vanessa:
Oh. 

559
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,160
Dan:
Because now we don't really  

560
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,640
associate flying with just defense, but 
it can certainly be used as a defense,  

561
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,600
so a bird will fly away when you come near it. And 
we were talking about it earlier and saying that  

562
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,840
flying probably evolved as a defense mechanism for 
an animal to get out of the way from a predator  

563
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,126
really efficiently and effectively.
Vanessa: 

564
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah, I almost said flying too for this one.
Dan: 

565
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

566
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,480
It's a good one.
Dan: 

567
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,400
So, I mean, but who doesn't want to fly?
Vanessa: 

568
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,960
Yeah.
Dan: 

569
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,440
I mean, of course then you 
have to be really lightweight  

570
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,520
and you're probably not very intimidating. 
And then, you have to be a bat or a bird. 

571
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,640
Vanessa:
You could be an Eagle. 

572
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Dan:
But, if I could still be me and fly,  

573
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,640
then I would choose that.
Vanessa: 

574
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,560
Yeah, just imagine, you're walking down a dark 
alley, I don't know why you're walking down a  

575
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,200
dark alley, and then somebody dangerous 
steps out and all of a sudden your wings  

576
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,720
open up and you fly away.
Dan: 

577
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
Ooh, they pop out of my back like an angel.
Vanessa: 

578
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,920
That's it. Yeah, that's it. I think there's 
some X-Men or superhero or something  

579
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,480
that does that.
Dan: 

580
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,516
Oh, yeah, probably. We 
don't know about that stuff. 

581
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:08,160
Dan:
Bird man. 

582
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
Vanessa:
Bird man. Is that a- 

583
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,840
Dan:
Or Batman, squawk man. 

584
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,440
Vanessa:
... Eagle man. 

585
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,090
Dan:
Eagle man. 

586
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,694
Vanessa:
Okay. 

587
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,320
Dan:
Raven man. Robin man.  

588
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,440
Robin.
Vanessa: 

589
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
California condo man.
Dan: 

590
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,920
Blue bird man.
Vanessa: 

591
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,080
These are all the birds we know. Okay, well-
Dan: 

592
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,397
And we're not into superheroes, so.
Vanessa: 

593
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:28,320
... Flying is a good one. I almost said that. 
And you know what? I think, I have something  

594
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,600
different I'd like to share. But, I think for me 
actually flying is probably more realistic. Not  

595
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,400
like I can actually fly, but because if I'm faced 
with danger, I'm probably more likely to flee. 

596
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,040
Dan:
Oh, yeah. 

597
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
Vanessa:
Than to fight. So, we call this fight or flight.  

598
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,840
When you're in a dangerous situation, either 
dangerous physically or dangerous emotionally,  

599
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,400
we say, "Oh, your fight or flight kicks in."  

600
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,720
So, either you fight and you try 
to win or you flee. So, that's- 

601
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,534
Dan:
Run away. 

602
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,760
Vanessa:
... The flight part. You're not actually flying,  

603
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,920
but maybe you try to run away from that dangerous 
situation. And I think for me, that's more true.  

604
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm more likely to run away from danger.
Dan: 

605
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,480
Lady folk, in general.
Vanessa: 

606
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,040
But I said something dinner... Dinner? 
Different. I said something different. 

607
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
Dan:
Food is still on her mind. 

608
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,560
Vanessa:
Oh, food. I said something  

609
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,960
different. I said, a horny toad, which is actually 
a type of lizard. A horny toad has something very  

610
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,440
interesting that they do. They, when faced with 
danger can stop their blood flow to their heart.  

611
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,333
Their blood fills up in them and they shoot 
blood out of their eyes at their aggressor. What? 

612
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,200
Dan:
Into their aggressor's eyes? 

613
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,760
Vanessa:
At least at their aggressor. And the blood  

614
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,080
isn't venomous or anything like this, it's just 
shocking. So, I thought it would be hilarious. 

615
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
Dan:
That would shock me. 

616
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,320
Vanessa:
If, "Oh, hi, I'm Vanessa. Nice Vanessa."  

617
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,560
And then, somebody is a bad person and I just 
went bzz and shot blood out my eyes at them. 

618
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,856
Dan:
Yeah. 

619
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:08,800
Vanessa:
I think it would be so shocking  

620
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,513
that I could be saved.
Dan: 

621
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:10,880
Sure.
Vanessa: 

622
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,080
But, maybe flying is something I would 
realistically be more likely to do.  

623
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,960
Oh, I probably would fly away instead of 
fighting. But, shooting blood out of your  

624
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
eyes if you're in danger?
Dan: 

625
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,640
It's not going to win you a lot of dates.
Vanessa: 

626
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
No.
Dan: 

627
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,200
"Hey, baby."
Vanessa: 

628
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,360
"Look what I can do." Yeah, but isn't that crazy, 
that it's actually a lizard, but the horn toad  

629
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,400
can shoot blood out of its eyes? How in the world- 

630
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,917
Dan:
And how does that even help it? 

631
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,400
Vanessa:
... Did even nature decide to do this? 

632
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,160
Dan:
I don't know. 

633
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,920
Vanessa:
I mean, it must be  

634
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,623
in danger in some ways that it goes away, it makes 
stuff go away because of that. Anyway, crazy, so. 

635
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:49,360
Dan:
The animal is just so disgusted,  

636
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,122
it doesn't want to eat it.
Vanessa: 

637
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:55,840
I know. "You got blood shooting out of your eyes. 
What?" So, I want to know for you, if you could  

638
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:02,160
have any animal's defense mechanism, what would it 
be? There are many crazy things out there. There  

639
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,960
are ants that shoot acid, there are porcupines 
that have quills. This is a great way to expand  

640
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,560
your vocabulary in a fun way. If you would like, 
you can type into Google amazing animal defense  

641
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,520
mechanisms. And you'll see many lists of cool 
things that animals do if you like that stuff.  

642
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,080
So I want to know, let me know in the comments, 
what would you like to defend yourself with?  

643
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,764
All right, let's go to our next question.
Dan: 

644
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,880
"Caw."
Vanessa: 

645
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,600
Question number seven is about holidays.  

646
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,480
The question is, what is your favorite holiday 
tradition? And I have a feeling that we might  

647
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,440
have the same one.
Dan: 

648
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,240
We had to have.
Vanessa: 

649
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,000
So do you want to say it at the same time?
Dan: 

650
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,240
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

651
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,800
On three?
Dan: 

652
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,200
Yes.
Vanessa: 

653
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,571
Okay. 3, 2, 1,
Dan: 

654
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:47,600
Christmas tree.
Vanessa: 

655
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,240
Decorating the Christmas tree.
Dan: 

656
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,920
Yes. Decorating the Christmas tree.
Vanessa: 

657
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,280
Yeah. Okay. Why don't you explain first? Why 
do you like decorating the Christmas tree? 

658
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Dan:
Man. There's probably  

659
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,840
a lot of reasons. One primary reason is that 
this is a tradition that our family always did. 

660
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,093
Vanessa:
Mm-hmm. 

661
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:07,440
Dan:
So it has a lot of nostalgia tied up into it.  

662
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,840
And we don't have a lot of other traditions that 
our family always did. So there's Thanksgiving,  

663
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,040
which is, you have a meal and you talk about 
what you're thankful for. And that's another  

664
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,800
big one. But, maybe it's just because you 
put presents under a tree that, as a kid,  

665
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
you just can't get enough of Christmas.
Vanessa: 

666
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
And now?
Dan: 

667
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,600
Yes. And now, I really enjoy picking out a 
Christmas tree. We're really nature-y. So,  

668
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,880
we get a real Christmas tree and I like the 
smell of the pine. It just hits all of the  

669
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,360
right senses and feelings. And then, you get 
to decorate it. So, your kids are excited,  

670
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,160
and you get to hang up all the stuff, and put 
up the lights, and there's a whole process. And,  

671
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
it's funny because it's probably the most 
useless thing that we do, but it's one of  

672
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,040
the best things.
Vanessa: 

673
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,560
Yeah. I think, even before we had 
kids, this was a big deal for us. 

674
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,200
Dan:
Of course. 

675
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Vanessa:
In our marriage,  

676
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,720
because yeah, it's something that you do with 
your parents growing up. And then, for us,  

677
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,480
when we got married and we started doing 
that with each other, it felt like,  

678
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,360
"Oh, this is our new life. This is us. 
We're doing this together." And you're- 

679
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,428
Dan:
We're starting the new generation. 

680
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:23,600
Vanessa:
... Yeah, our new traditions. We're doing this in  

681
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:31,040
our own way. Yeah, it felt different. I said that 
for me, because when I was a kid, we didn't have a  

682
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,760
real Christmas tree, we had a fake tree. But even 
in that, I was so excited about it. First of all,  

683
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,080
I'll set the stage, my mom popped popcorn. So, we 
ate popcorn and it smelled great. We listened to  

684
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,973
Christmas music.
Dan: 

685
00:41:44,973 --> 00:41:45,440
Always good.
Vanessa: 

686
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
And then, we all sat in the living 
room, and because we had a fake tree,  

687
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,880
there's different fake trees, but the kind we 
had, there was a stem in the middle and it had  

688
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,880
different holes and you could hook the branches 
in and the branches had different colored rings  

689
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,040
on them, so you could see the big ones are on the 
bottom. But, because these were closed in a box  

690
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,280
the entire year, they were flat. So, we 
would all sit around the Christmas tree,  

691
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,720
bending the branches to look realistic. So, we 
would bend each of the little branches on it and  

692
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,480
then put it in. And we'd look at each other's and 
say, "Oh, that one doesn't look good." Or, "Oh,  

693
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,920
that was really great."
Dan: 

694
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,600
This is all blasphemy to me.
Vanessa: 

695
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,720
Because you always had a real tree.
Dan: 

696
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,600
It had to be real.
Vanessa: 

697
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,160
And then we-
Dan: 

698
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,480
If there's not a fire hazard in your living room,  

699
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,000
it's not Christmas.
Vanessa: 

700
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,560
... Yeah, that's a big reason why we had a 
fake tree is because when my dad was a kid,  

701
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,680
they had a real tree.
Dan: 

702
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,160
Oh, yeah.
Vanessa: 

703
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,120
Maybe for one Christmas, I don't remember 
if it was for longer than that. And they had  

704
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,000
a train set going around it so they could turn 
on the electric train and it would go around the  

705
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,320
bottom of the Christmas tree, not in the branches, 
but just on the ground, and it caught fire. 

706
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,581
Dan:
Oh. 

707
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,880
Vanessa:
And my dad said one of his first memories  

708
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,560
is him as a little kid, getting a cup of water and 
throwing it on the Christmas tree fire. This is  

709
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,907
huge hazard. And there's so many warnings.
Dan: 

710
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:04,720
I mean, I don't think so much anymore.
Vanessa: 

711
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,143
Yeah, this is a big deal.
Dan: 

712
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:08,480
Christmas trees are safe.
Vanessa: 

713
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,160
Christmas trees are not safe, because they say 
now, I think it's more known now that you should  

714
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,080
always keep water, so you have the Christmas tree 
that's cut and you put it in a little basin of  

715
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,840
water, and if there's not water in there, the tree 
will dry out and it will catch fire really easily.  

716
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,080
But, if it's filled with water, then the tree 
is hydrated and it won't catch fire as easily. 

717
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Dan:
But also, 60s electronics, versus- 

718
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,416
Vanessa:
Okay. That's true. 

719
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,080
Dan:
... Today's electronics. They're not  

720
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
going to catch fire the same way.
Vanessa: 

721
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah.
Dan: 

722
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,720
Probably.
Vanessa: 

723
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,080
Yeah.
Dan: 

724
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Christmas trees are safe and the best.
Vanessa: 

725
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,680
Dan loves Christmas trees. So, I remember, 
yeah, we would do that, and then we would  

726
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,320
decorate the tree. And my mom always had one 
ornament, which I now have that was the first  

727
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,644
ornament we put on the tree.
Dan: 

728
00:43:51,644 --> 00:43:52,480
Which one was that?
Vanessa: 

729
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,040
It's the ball that has lots of 
little beads on it. And it's got- 

730
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,080
Dan:
Ball with beads. 

731
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,240
Vanessa:
... Ribbons, and knots, and stuff on it.  

732
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,440
We have it.
Dan: 

733
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,800
Well, I love Christmas trees and 
I can't remember this ornament. 

734
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,080
Vanessa:
Oh, well it's in our house. 

735
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,520
Dan:
That's good. It'll be refreshing  

736
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,600
this year to see it later.
Vanessa: 

737
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,360
And, she put that on the tree and that 
signified, we can start to decorate the tree.  

738
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,672
So yeah, we would decorate the tree together 
and it was just a nice time to do that. 

739
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:20,880
Dan:
How did you guys sit back and not decorate  

740
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,000
the tree right away? Our children are like, 
"Bah, get all the stuff. Put it on right away." 

741
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,720
Vanessa:
Yeah, we did the ornaments. We  

742
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,144
were busy doing the branches.
Dan: 

743
00:44:28,144 --> 00:44:30,640
Maybe because it's two girls versus two boys.
Vanessa: 

744
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,400
I don't know. But, we did it and it was 
fun. And I remember when we got married,  

745
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,640
that was my first real Christmas tree. We 
went to a place and got a real tree and- 

746
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,600
Dan:
That was your first? 

747
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,080
Vanessa:
... Yeah. 

748
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,760
Dan:
Oh, we got the little one. 

749
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,036
Vanessa:
We got a little tree. Yeah. 

750
00:44:45,036 --> 00:44:46,160
Dan:
That we planted later. 

751
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,960
Vanessa:
Oh, yeah. 

752
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,240
Dan:
That's another thing you can do  

753
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,120
sometimes in America, but it's more difficult.
Vanessa: 

754
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,068
Yeah, you can get it with the root ball on 
the bottom. The first year we were married- 

755
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:55,920
Dan:
It's a lot heavier. 

756
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,520
Vanessa:
... Oh my goodness, it was  

757
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
so heavy. I remember it took three of us.
Dan: 

758
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,120
It was three feet tall.
Vanessa: 

759
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,840
Me, you, and your brother to take it  

760
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,727
out of the car and drag it into our house.
Dan: 

761
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:07,360
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa: 

762
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,720
Because it was so big, but we wanted to plant it 
later, we didn't want to just cut a tree down. So,  

763
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,920
we got this tree with a root ball, 
but ever since then, we've just gotten  

764
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,160
a cut tree, and put it in our house, and 
decorated it. And yeah, it's a lot of fun. 

765
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,360
Dan:
Always a happy time. 

766
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,720
Vanessa:
Yeah. Well, I want to know for you, what is  

767
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,480
your favorite holiday tradition? It might not be 
about Christmas. It could be about any holiday.  

768
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,440
But, I want to know about your experience. Let us 
know in the comments, what's your favorite holiday  

769
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,440
tradition? And we'll go on to our next question. 
Question number nine is about sports and exercise.  

770
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,600
What is the most recent sport that you did?
Dan: 

771
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,480
Well, this happened just about a week ago 
actually. And it's the first time I ever did this  

772
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,190
outdoors. It was rock climbing. Is 
this a sport? I guess, it's a sport. 

773
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,829
Vanessa:
It's considered exercise. 

774
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,720
Dan:
Yeah. And so, my brother-in-law is,  

775
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,520
let's just say, obsessed with rock climbing. And, 
he's gotten pretty good at it lately. And so,  

776
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,160
he met us in between where he lives and 
us. We live about eight hours away. And,  

777
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,880
we were in West Virginia, which has actually a lot 
of good rock climbing. And we chose a spot and he  

778
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,640
had all the gear, he's got the ropes, he's got 
the shoes, he's got the backpacks, he's got the  

779
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,840
harness, and all this stuff. And he actually... 
Oh the helmet too. Don't forget the helmet.  

780
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,080
And, he geared me up to do it. And, I 
was actually pretty nervous about it,  

781
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,600
and not because I'm afraid of heights actually, 
he's more scared of Heights than I am.  

782
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,880
I think it's funny that he likes doing this 
so much. He says every single time he does it,  

783
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,760
he's scared.
Vanessa: 

784
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,320
Oh.
Dan: 

785
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,880
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

786
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,680
Interesting.
Dan: 

787
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,320
But I'm not afraid of heights, so I wasn't really 
worried about that. I probably should have been  

788
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,960
more worried about it.
Vanessa: 

789
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,720
What were you worried about?
Dan: 

790
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,960
I'm a perfectionist, or a completionist. So, 
it really bothers me if I try something and I  

791
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,760
can't finish it.
Vanessa: 

792
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,320
Ah, so you wanted to be 
able to make it to the top. 

793
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,520
Dan:
So, I knew I could probably do some easy stuff,  

794
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,160
but he's a lot better than I am. So, I knew 
that he would be wanting to move on to something  

795
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,560
more challenging. And, I didn't really know if I 
wanted to have to just watch, or try it and only  

796
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,795
get partway. In the end, I did do that. So, the 
first one was a easy one. I don't think it was- 

797
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:36,960
Vanessa:
I'll show you a picture here of Dan  

798
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,446
making it all the way to the top. Yes.
Dan: 

799
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:47,440
... Yes. So, I do naturally have a good body type 
for climbing. I'm lightweight. I climb a lot of  

800
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:56,400
trees. I like to hike and do all that stuff. So, I 
can figure it out. But, the hand strength is just  

801
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,520
on another level to rock climb.
Vanessa: 

802
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,840
Yeah.
Dan: 

803
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,840
And so, I did the easier one and I made it to the 
top. But, all the other ones, I made it partway.  

804
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,840
And, I actually remember, we were with 
another guy too, his name was Jim. And,  

805
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,280
Jim was really inspiring, because... And don't 
worry, this was totally safe. There was a rope  

806
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:24,080
tied to the very top. They call it top climbing? 
Top rope? I don't remember the terms. There's a  

807
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,440
lot of terms in rock climbing.
Vanessa: 

808
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,920
Yeah.
Dan: 

809
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,480
And so, he was tied to the top and if you fall 
that will catch you right away and it's not a  

810
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,106
big deal.
Vanessa: 

811
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:33,360
Yeah.
Dan: 

812
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:41,520
But, for me, if I fall one time doing that, I'm 
like, "All right, I'm done." That's how I feel.  

813
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,360
But he fell probably 15 times on a climb and 
just kept on trying, and trying, and trying,  

814
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,880
and he made it to the top and I was like, "Wow." 
And, when he got down, I said, "I have to try  

815
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,920
a lot more than I would, because I just 
saw him persevere." So, it's a very good  

816
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,028
perseverance sport.
Vanessa: 

817
00:49:02,028 --> 00:49:02,240
Yeah.
Dan: 

818
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,560
So, I tried, and tried, and tried, and I got one 
third of the way, because it was really difficult.  

819
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,440
It's called crack climbing. And there's just 
a crack in the wall. And, you got to put your  

820
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,000
hands there. And, just-
Vanessa: 

821
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,667
That's so hard.
Dan: 

822
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:24,640
... There's nothing except for a crack and 
little tiny ledges. So, their experienced,  

823
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,720
so they got up the first part really easily. 
So, the girl who was with us, she said,  

824
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,680
"Yeah, that was tricky." But, I 
was stuck on the first part for...  

825
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,480
It felt like 20 minutes, it was probably more 
like 10 minutes. They just got up that part. But  

826
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,800
it was literally just a little thin rock you had 
to put your fingers in, barely any foothold. But,  

827
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,889
I saw Jim fall, and fall, and fall, and I 
kept on trying and I finally did it. Yes. 

828
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:58,080
Vanessa:
Wow. Man, that is not up my alley at all. 

829
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,630
Dan:
Yeah. Brad asked me... Brad's my  

830
00:49:59,630 --> 00:49:59,908
brother-in-law. He said, "Do you think Vanessa 
would ever do this with you?" And I was like- 

831
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:01,280
Dan:
Brad's my brother-in-law. He said,  

832
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,480
"Do you think Vanessa would ever do this with 
you?" And I was like, "I don't think..." I can't  

833
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,474
imagine you wanting to do that.
Vanessa: 

834
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:17,040
Yeah. I don't like heights like that, and I feel 
like I can't just do something like that like you.  

835
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,720
I would need to go to the climbing gym and feel 
comfortable with it, because at least for me,  

836
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:31,440
that takes a lot of upper body strength, 
your abs, your arms, your fingers. I think  

837
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,520
maybe for you, you were able to make it to the 
top of the easier one and halfway up or a third  

838
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:47,760
of the way up the other ones because you're not 
afraid of heights and your strength is distributed  

839
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,960
differently than mine.
Dan: 

840
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,520
Yes.
Vanessa: 

841
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,920
But I think for something like that, I would need 
to massively feel more comfortable with heights  

842
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,120
and go to the gym in advance.
Dan: 

843
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,200
The girl who was with us was the best one there. 

844
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,840
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

845
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,400
Dan:
She was  

846
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:00,960
amazing.
Vanessa: 

847
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,360
I bet.
Dan: 

848
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,600
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

849
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,662
I mean, you can practice that and do it.
Dan: 

850
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:03,600
Women can definitely do it.
Vanessa: 

851
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
Yeah. That's the cool thing.
Dan: 

852
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,640
She was kind of like spider monkey, though.
Vanessa: 

853
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,440
Going everywhere.
Dan: 

854
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,600
She hadn't had any children yet.
Vanessa: 

855
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,400
Yeah, maybe.
Dan: 

856
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,880
Children does a number on 
you. I speak from experience. 

857
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,520
Vanessa:
Yeah? In any case, I think that seems like  

858
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:27,920
the kind of exercise or sport that I would need to 
practice in advance before going outside to do it,  

859
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,120
and inside where there's, I don't 
know, maybe more predictability- 

860
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,257
Dan:
Mats. 

861
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,080
Vanessa:
... or practice, that would be better for me. 

862
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,600
Dan:
I thought it was more fun outside. 

863
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:37,722
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

864
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:39,920
Dan:
Because I've done climbing gyms before,  

865
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,480
and it's okay, but outside's a whole 
adventure. It did take forever though. 

866
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,509
Vanessa:
Yeah. You have to hook up everything. 

867
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,840
Dan:
We did four climbs and we were there all day.  

868
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,040
You're watching other people go, and also one 
person has to be the... I forget what it's called. 

869
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,600
Vanessa:
Belay. 

870
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,120
Dan:
Belay. Yeah. One person's holding you,  

871
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,080
making sure you're not going to fall down, so 
they actually hold you up from the other end. 

872
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,200
Vanessa:
Cool. 

873
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,400
Dan:
I don't know all the terms,  

874
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,960
but you can imagine it, right?
Vanessa: 

875
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,120
Yeah. It seemed like cool camaraderie 
too with everybody who was there. 

876
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,480
Dan:
Yeah. That was probably the best part. 

877
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,400
Vanessa:
As in we all went together,  

878
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,680
and then I went on a hike with Dan's sister 
and our kids and Dan's parents. We were  

879
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,120
at the same place, but hiking instead. But we were 
going back and watching them too. It seemed like  

880
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:38,160
everyone who was in this area climbing just was 
chill. They were all the type of perseverant,  

881
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,694
motivated type of person, who's like, "I'm 
going to climb this rock," a personal challenge. 

882
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:41,840
Dan:
It's a culture, for sure. 

883
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,023
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

884
00:52:42,023 --> 00:52:44,319
Dan:
Yeah. One guy walked up and there was a climb,  

885
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,960
they all have funny names, and he was like, "Did 
you do chalk line? Cool, bro." It was totally- 

886
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,640
Vanessa:
Trying to size each other up. 

887
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,480
Dan:
Surfer vibes. 

888
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,960
Vanessa:
Yeah. I could see that. Well,  

889
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,120
sounds like a fun time, even though it was hard.
Dan: 

890
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,720
Oh, it twas very hard. Very hard.
Vanessa: 

891
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,840
Bonding together.
Dan: 

892
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,480
Yes. How about you? Have you 
tried any sports recently? 

893
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,280
Vanessa:
Yeah, I was trying to think about this,  

894
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,680
and the answer is not really, but-
Dan: 

895
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,560
Baseball.
Vanessa: 

896
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,758
I was going to say baseball.
Dan: 

897
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:13,200
Really?
Vanessa: 

898
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,720
Because our four year old, almost five year 
old, maybe by the time you're watching this  

899
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:27,840
he'll be five, our five year old son has been into 
hitting the baseball with a baseball bat lately.  

900
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,728
In June, we visited Pittsburgh when Dan went-
Dan: 

901
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:34,432
Rock climbing.
Vanessa: 

902
00:53:34,432 --> 00:53:37,920
... rock climbing. After that, 
we went to a baseball field with  

903
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,960
Dan's sister and their cousins and some 
family, little kids. We tried to kind of  

904
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,840
play a baseball field.
Dan: 

905
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,560
Tried. Yes.
Vanessa: 

906
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,160
There's bases, and we were all hitting. The kids 
hit, we hit, and I've always liked hitting a  

907
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,520
baseball. I think it's pretty fun.
Dan: 

908
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,640
That's when you realize how many 
rules there are in baseball. 

909
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,120
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

910
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,040
Dan:
"Don't run with the bat." "First base is over  

911
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,960
there." "No, you have to stop on the base." "Wait, 
he's going to throw the ball to you." It's like,  

912
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,040
forget about it. Just let him hit the ball.
Vanessa: 

913
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,760
Yeah. It was really funny to see our son hit 
the ball. He was just so excited that he hit it  

914
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,480
that he was holding onto the bat and he ran to 
third base. Like, "No, no, no. That way drop the  

915
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,440
bat. Go that way."
Dan: 

916
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:19,680
Yes.
Vanessa: 

917
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,440
We were just having fun. Yeah, it was fun, 
and I like hitting. Yeah. I've always liked  

918
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,240
hitting a baseball. Even though it wasn't 
organized, like an actual organized sport,  

919
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,400
I think that was still a sport. It 
wasn't too much exercise, but it was fun. 

920
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
Dan:
I have a funny story about  

921
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,040
baseball. Can I share it?
Vanessa: 

922
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,240
Yes.
Dan: 

923
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,000
When I was a kid.
Vanessa: 

924
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,880
Go ahead.
Dan: 

925
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,280
When I was a kid, I played baseball up until 
coach pitch, which is where the coach is pitching,  

926
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,360
not the players. Then I started getting 
scared of how fast the ball was coming.  

927
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,040
At least back then, that's how I felt. But one 
time I was the first baseman, and in baseball,  

928
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,280
it's a very slow sport, right? For kids, you 
just start getting distracted when they're not  

929
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,000
hitting the ball and you're just waiting out 
there. So, I was pretending to be Darth Vader  

930
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,920
with earth fader with my glove over my face. 
I was literally standing on first base going,  

931
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,400
and the player hit the ball 
and hit me on the glove,  

932
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,800
and we totally missed the play and it was 
because I was pretending to be Darth Vader  

933
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,840
on first base.
Vanessa: 

934
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,480
There you go.
Dan: 

935
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,520
That's my story.
Vanessa: 

936
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,920
Wow.
Dan: 

937
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,520
That's why I quit baseball.
Vanessa: 

938
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,160
Oh, man.
Dan: 

939
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,120
Actually, that's not why.
Vanessa: 

940
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,520
Yeah.
Dan: 

941
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,360
It's because I would practice with my 
brother and he would throw really hard and  

942
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,200
I didn't want to get hit by the ball.
Vanessa: 

943
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,703
Yeah. I mean, I don't blame you.
Dan: 

944
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:38,720
Baseball.
Vanessa: 

945
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,680
I wouldn't want to get hit by a baseball either. 
In the US, it's pretty common for kids to do,  

946
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:50,320
they call it little league, so there's different 
stages, and one stage might be like a parent is  

947
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,360
throwing the ball to the kids, or it's sitting on 
a tee, it's sitting on a little stand and the kids  

948
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,240
just have to try to hit the ball. Then the next 
level might be another player is throwing it, or  

949
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,080
then the coach is throwing it as you get more and 
more advanced. So, it's kind of working you up to  

950
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,280
being a better player.
Dan: 

951
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,400
To the majors.
Vanessa: 

952
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,000
To the majors. Well, that was your first 
answer, right? You wished you could be  

953
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,960
a famous sports player.
Dan: 

954
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,640
I'd take the best baseball player,  

955
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,080
or just really great.
Vanessa: 

956
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,720
Cool. Okay.
Dan: 

957
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,400
Yeah. Any sport. I love sport.
Vanessa: 

958
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,080
Well, I want to ask you the same question. What 
was the most recent sport that you've played?  

959
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,600
It could be an organized sport like baseball, 
or it could be something that's just more  

960
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,755
exercise, like-
Dan: 

961
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:33,333
Like rock climbing.
Vanessa: 

962
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,880
... rock climbing, but some people might 
say it's a sport. Let us know in the  

963
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,480
comments what's the most recent sport you've 
played, and we'll go on to our next question.  

964
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,440
Question number 10 is about electronics. This 
is another hypothetical question. If you could  

965
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,040
invent any new electronic device, 
what would it be and what would it do? 

966
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,520
Dan:
When I first  

967
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:02,400
was thinking about this, I thought gadgets, 
like a new toaster that never burnt the toast. 

968
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,562
Vanessa:
Okay. 

969
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:05,840
Dan:
But I think when I think of  

970
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:15,120
noble uses for electronics, I think of the medical 
field. My electronic invention would be a tiny  

971
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,947
robot that kills cancer.
Vanessa: 

972
00:57:17,947 --> 00:57:18,640
Oh, okay.
Dan: 

973
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,840
A cancer killing search and destroy robot.
Vanessa: 

974
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Wow. That's noble.
Dan: 

975
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,880
I think they might be working on this.
Vanessa: 

976
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,160
Yeah. I don't know much about that field.
Dan: 

977
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:37,280
I think there is some kind of tiny robot, 
for lack of a better word, that can find  

978
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:44,480
certain diseases or cells in the body. You know, 
I do not have a background in biotech at all,  

979
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,440
but I would almost guarantee somebody's trying to 
figure out how to get tiny robots that can find  

980
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,988
and kill cancer in people.
Vanessa: 

981
00:57:53,988 --> 00:57:54,800
That sounds great.
Dan: 

982
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,240
That would be probably the best 
use of an electronic gadget. 

983
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,080
Vanessa:
Mine is very selfish compared to that. 

984
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,280
Dan:
Yeah, because  

985
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,560
nothing sucks more than cancer, I 
think. This is just the worst thing. 

986
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,840
Vanessa:
Yeah. Well, if you are in biotech or if you are  

987
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,280
a cancer related doctor or surgeon-
Dan: 

988
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,840
Send me your number and I'll tell you my plans.
Vanessa: 

989
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,080
Yeah. Let us know. Does something like this 
exists? Is this something that's in the works?  

990
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,160
Yeah. Never know.
Dan: 

991
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,720
Yeah. How about you? How many cancer destroying 
things are you creating in your spare time? 

992
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,120
Vanessa:
Oh, sorry. Mine's very selfish.  

993
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:42,400
I was thinking more personal. In our house, to 
go to our deck, we have a sliding door. There's  

994
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,440
a glass sliding door, and then there's a screen 
that you can just push through. It's a magnet,  

995
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,720
you can just go through it. But in the summer, we 
try to keep the glass sliding door closed because  

996
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:59,360
there's air conditioning in our house and it's 
super hot and muggy, humid outside, so we don't  

997
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:06,400
want that air to get inside. We want it to stay 
cool inside. We go in and out a lot in our house.  

998
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:14,800
With young children, it's kind of tricky 
to get them to keep that glass door closed.  

999
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,920
It's also kind of heavy.
Dan: 

1000
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,120
The sliding door.
Vanessa: 

1001
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,280
Yeah, for them to pull it open is okay, and then 
they bust through the screen door and they're  

1002
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,760
outside like, "I'm going to go do something," 
and they don't think about the glass door.  

1003
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,920
And for me too, sometimes if I'm carrying 
something, I have to open the door.  

1004
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:37,440
My electronic gadget would be a button 
that you can push that would open the door,  

1005
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:44,560
and then automatically within 30 seconds, it would 
close the door, so you have time to go through  

1006
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,720
and it would close. It might be sensor 
by your body, so if you're still  

1007
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,120
in the doorway it wouldn't close, but 
that way it would always close behind us. 

1008
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,920
Dan:
Couldn't you just use in the grocery  

1009
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,440
store where it automatically opens?
Vanessa: 

1010
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,468
Yeah, something like that.
Dan: 

1011
00:59:58,468 --> 00:59:59,386
A sliding automatic door.
Vanessa: 

1012
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,680
But people don't have that in their house.
Dan: 

1013
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,480
Oh. But it's only a matter of money.
Vanessa: 

1014
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,760
I mean, maybe we could get something 
like that installed in our house now,  

1015
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,920
but I was kind of envisioning, I imagine people 
who are handicapped or in a wheelchair, maybe they  

1016
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,737
have something like this that's automatic.
Dan: 

1017
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,320
Probably.
Vanessa: 

1018
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,120
I'm sure it's a big system you have to install. 
It's probably a lot of money or kind of a hassle,  

1019
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,960
but I'm sure there's some kind of system.
Dan: 

1020
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,120
Well, we could go to a closed down grocery 
store, and every time it opens, it says,  

1021
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,480
"Welcome to Aldi."
Vanessa: 

1022
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,400
As in we would take Aldi's doors?
Dan: 

1023
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:32,640
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1024
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,040
And put them in our house, and it would have a 
speaker that says, "Welcome to the grocery store,"  

1025
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,920
every time we open our house's doors?
Dan: 

1026
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,200
It'd be the most charming thing 
we could possibly add to our home. 

1027
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,720
Vanessa:
Maybe we could have it say,  

1028
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,400
"Welcome home, Vanessa."
Dan: 

1029
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
Oh, yeah. Programmable.
Vanessa: 

1030
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,280
I don't think I would like my doors to talk.
Dan: 

1031
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,560
And it also takes off your hat. 

1032
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,440
Vanessa:
Wow. 

1033
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,160
Dan:
With an arm. 

1034
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,360
Vanessa:
Maybe it also feeds you food and gives you water. 

1035
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,720
Dan:
And it's a conveyor belt too,  

1036
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,800
so you don't have to walk through it.
Vanessa: 

1037
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,656
And maybe it is also your brain, 
so you don't have to think. 

1038
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:04,000
Dan:
And there's another arm that  

1039
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,040
puts a soda in your hand.
Vanessa: 

1040
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:15,680
That's weird. Yes. I would like our glass sliding 
door to be closed more easily so that it is not a  

1041
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:22,960
personal hassle or an annoyance in our home. But 
I must say that Dan's cancer fighting robots are  

1042
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:29,440
probably a better idea. Anyway, I thought 
about this question for about 4.2 seconds. 

1043
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,280
Dan:
And I thought of it for four minutes. 

1044
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,080
Vanessa:
Okay. 

1045
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,654
Dan:
To be fair. 

1046
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:33,760
Vanessa:
Yeah. So,  

1047
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,240
maybe if I thought about it for four minutes 
I would've come up with a better idea. Anyway,  

1048
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,840
what about you? What kind of new electronic gadget 
would you like to invent, and what would it do?  

1049
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,440
Let us know in the comments and we'll go to our 
next question. Question number 11 is about money.  

1050
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,960
I'd like to know what is something that you 
can justify spending more money on and why? 

1051
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,200
Dan:
Yeah. Justify. I mean, probably speakers. 

1052
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,040
Vanessa:
We always talk about speakers. 

1053
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,960
Dan:
I'm kidding. I like audio stuff a lot.  

1054
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,840
I would say maybe once a year I just start 
looking into some audio equipment or some kind  

1055
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,120
of electronics, usually. I'm like, "Vanessa, do 
you think we could?" She's like, "No, we have 10  

1056
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
speakers," or headphones or something. You know?
Vanessa: 

1057
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,440
We talked about this in past videos.
Dan: 

1058
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,280
Yes. This is not actually 
my answer. I said property. 

1059
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,720
Vanessa:
Oh, okay. 

1060
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,800
Dan:
Yeah, because I know for sure  

1061
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,160
we want to have another property.
Vanessa: 

1062
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,200
Like in the woods?
Dan: 

1063
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:41,840
Yes. We would like to own, it might 
just be land, but maybe just a cabin.  

1064
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:49,680
This is a little bit nostalgic for me because 
my grandfather actually gave my parents  

1065
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,320
or I guess gave us access to a very simple cabin 
that we would go to in the mountains in Colorado,  

1066
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,680
and that was our little escape 
from the hubbub of normal life  

1067
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,440
going to that cabin.
Vanessa: 

1068
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,422
No electricity, no plumbing.
Dan: 

1069
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:13,960
Yes, but it has to be like that. It has to be 
off grid, basically. I mean, it had electricity. 

1070
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,640
Vanessa:
Oh, yeah. 

1071
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,200
Dan:
But it didn't  

1072
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,240
have running water.
Vanessa: 

1073
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,360
Ah, that was a thing.
Dan: 

1074
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,960
I mean, I think I'd take 
electricity. That's kind of nice. 

1075
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,680
Vanessa:
That is nice. 

1076
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,480
Dan:
I don't know. We'll debate the details later, but  

1077
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:31,680
I know for sure I want to have some more property. 
You can always justify it by saying, "Well,  

1078
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:39,040
this is an investment too. You can always resell 
it." Usually with property you'll at least make  

1079
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,316
back what you bought it for.
Vanessa: 

1080
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:41,520
Hopefully.
Dan: 

1081
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,160
Especially in this area, it's always growing,  

1082
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:50,000
so I can make a lot of justifications for 
why we need to own many beach homes. I mean- 

1083
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,503
Vanessa:
Mountain- 

1084
01:03:51,503 --> 01:03:51,680
Dan:
... mountain homes. 

1085
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Vanessa:
... cabins. Yeah. When you were a kid- 

1086
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:53,886
Dan:
Many. 

1087
01:03:53,886 --> 01:03:54,560
Vanessa:
... you would  

1088
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,080
just go to the mountains with your mom 
and siblings and play in the woods and  

1089
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,880
catch critters.
Dan: 

1090
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,520
Yeah. There was acres of land there. There wasn't 
as many critters as I would've liked there. 

1091
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:05,960
Vanessa:
Oh, yeah. 

1092
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,120
Dan:
But there was a pond and there  

1093
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,640
were dragon flies and fish.
Vanessa: 

1094
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,680
Oh, that sounds fun.
Dan: 

1095
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,080
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1096
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,840
I think that's a beautiful childhood too, being 
able to do stuff like that. We go hiking a lot,  

1097
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,880
but there's something special about staying there.
Dan: 

1098
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,360
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1099
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,800
In the cabin and you go back to the same place, 
maybe different seasons, and get to know the  

1100
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,398
seasons there.
Dan: 

1101
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:27,520
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1102
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,160
That's cool.
Dan: 

1103
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah. The best thing about the cabin that we 
had was it had a loft. It doesn't seem very safe  

1104
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,880
thinking back to it, because my memory of it is it 
was like a plywood deck hanging from the ceiling. 

1105
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,533
Vanessa:
Did it have a- 

1106
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:47,280
Dan:
It was hanging down, and you climbed a ladder up  

1107
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,520
to it. It had plywood walls, but there were gaps 
in the walls too, where you could just jump down,  

1108
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:59,520
which we didn't jump down. But what we did was 
because it was a one room cabin, if my parents  

1109
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,400
were there with some friends or my grandparents, 
they would play cards, and they would send us to  

1110
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,120
bed, but we could hear everything, so we'd spy on 
them and we'd drop stuff down on them and stuff. 

1111
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,920
Vanessa:
That sounds fun. 

1112
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,040
Dan:
Yeah. That was fun. 

1113
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,760
Vanessa:
Wow, so maybe we can recreate this  

1114
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,000
rustic experience.
Dan: 

1115
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,080
We need a loft.
Vanessa: 

1116
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,560
Do you think it would be just as fun as 
an adult? Because you were a kid doing it,  

1117
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,200
do you think that-
Dan: 

1118
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,320
To sleep in the loft?
Vanessa: 

1119
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:28,320
Well, for us, because we're adults now, so 
having this rural experience, would it be as  

1120
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,120
fun for us as it would-
Dan: 

1121
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,787
I think it would be.
Vanessa: 

1122
01:05:29,787 --> 01:05:30,640
... as for kids?
Dan: 

1123
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,240
Yeah, because one benefit of being in a place like  

1124
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,720
America and the United States is that you can 
usually find some place that is very rural  

1125
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,600
and quiet.
Vanessa: 

1126
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,840
Quickly and close.
Dan: 

1127
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,160
We live close enough to a highway 
and stuff that it would be nice to  

1128
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,480
just only hear the birds chirping.
Vanessa: 

1129
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,560
Yeah. I think that's really possible. I mean-
Dan: 

1130
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,000
And get away from electronics and stuff. It would 
have to be an intentional, this is not a place  

1131
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,320
where we have a TV, for example.
Vanessa: 

1132
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,800
Yeah. I think you can drive about 20 minutes away 
from our house and be very much in the woods. 

1133
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,240
Dan:
Yes. 

1134
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,000
Vanessa:
But anyway, that's a  

1135
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,880
specific discussion for another time.
Dan: 

1136
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,560
Yes.
Vanessa: 

1137
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,680
Cool. So, you'd like to have-
Dan: 

1138
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,362
More property.
Vanessa: 

1139
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:18,160
... a cabin, and that would be a investment, 
an investment that you could justify.  

1140
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,080
Well, I think for me, when I thought about this, 
I thought more of something that we already do  

1141
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,760
that we have justified spending more money on, so-
Dan: 

1142
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,200
Garden boxes.
Vanessa: 

1143
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,280
I spend too much money on the garden. That's true.  

1144
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,624
These are the world's most expensive tomatoes.
Dan: 

1145
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:41,200
We are now a small scale farm.
Vanessa: 

1146
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,840
That's not what I was saying, but that 
is true. I thought of something more  

1147
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:54,160
in our daily life. I think this is different for 
everyone depending on how much money you have. At  

1148
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:01,920
some point in our marriage, we bought the cheapest 
food. This is all that we could afford and  

1149
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:11,240
that was it. But then as we made more money, we 
wanted to intentionally buy better quality food. 

1150
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,560
Dan:
We prioritize it. 

1151
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,760
Vanessa:
Yeah. So, instead  

1152
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:20,800
of just buying expensive food, we wanted to buy, 
especially we kind of made an intention to buy  

1153
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:28,080
better quality animal products specifically. In 
the US, you have a lot of options. You could buy  

1154
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:35,360
organic carrots or conventional carrots, and 
not so much that I'm thinking more about meat  

1155
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,080
and yogurt and cheese and milk-
Dan: 

1156
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,840
Where the creatures are involved.
Vanessa: 

1157
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,240
Yeah, because in the area where we live, 
there's a lot of options for buying  

1158
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:53,440
local grass fed beef, for example, where 
there's a farm down the street and it's  

1159
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:00,640
much more expensive than buying the cheapest 
beef at the grocery store. But for us,  

1160
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,400
as we've made more money, this has been 
something that we justify spending more money on.  

1161
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:14,320
If we didn't have money, then I would not spend 
money on that, because that wasn't a priority. 

1162
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,000
Dan:
It would be hot dogs and canned tuna. 

1163
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,520
Vanessa:
I mean, maybe not hot dogs, but some beans  

1164
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,960
or just rice, something very simple.
Dan: 

1165
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,960
Rice and beans. There you go.
Vanessa: 

1166
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah. You can live off of that. Lots of people 
do. But for us, this has been something that  

1167
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,840
we have been intentional about. 
When we buy milk, we try to buy  

1168
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:41,119
good quality, not just expensive, but either 
local milk or something that's whole milk,  

1169
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,080
grass fed, something local, these types of things. 
We have our own chickens, so those are certainly- 

1170
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,040
Dan:
They're free range. 

1171
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,760
Vanessa:
Beautiful quality eggs. But this  

1172
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:58,800
type of thing, because I feel like it is directly 
impacting the farming world and the animal's life.  

1173
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:07,600
We are not vegan, we are not vegetarian, 
but I don't like conventional farms and  

1174
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,200
factory farms, big scale farms.
Dan: 

1175
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,040
From the standpoint of the animals?
Vanessa: 

1176
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,279
From a lot of standpoints, the environment, 
animals, all of that, maybe you're eating  

1177
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:23,119
too much meat, but I completely understand that 
if you don't have much money, you buy food. You  

1178
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:29,600
just have to buy the food that you buy and you 
have to survive. Then as you make more money,  

1179
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,600
you make different choices about what you buy. 
For us, that's been increasing the quality of  

1180
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:41,200
the animal products that we buy for a lot of 
different reasons. But anyway, that's something  

1181
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,399
that I can justify spending more money on.
Dan: 

1182
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,159
Yes. Better food.
Vanessa: 

1183
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah. That's something that we've chosen to 
spend more money on over time. That is probably  

1184
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,520
different for you. Let us know in the comments 
for you, what is something that you can justify  

1185
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,560
spending more money on, maybe in the future, like 
Dan's answer, some cabin or property, you could  

1186
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,840
justify spending more money on that, or maybe it's 
something that you already spend more money on,  

1187
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,720
like my answer. Let us know in the comments. 
I'm curious. What are your financial priorities?  

1188
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,120
Let us know in the comments, and let's go to the 
next question. Question number 11 is about games.  

1189
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,742
We like games.
Dan: 

1190
01:10:20,742 --> 01:10:22,000
Games. Are they fun?
Vanessa: 

1191
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,720
Yes.
Dan: 

1192
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,600
I don't know.
Vanessa: 

1193
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,720
I would like to know what is a game that you 
play that you're very competitive about. The  

1194
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,960
word competitive means you want to win. 
You feel serious, you can still have fun,  

1195
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,040
but you want to win.
Dan: 

1196
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,200
The real question for me is what is a 
game that I don't feel competitive about,  

1197
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:46,640
because I have a game switch in my head. I 
start playing a game and I'm like, "Strategy on,  

1198
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,440
let's win this thing," and I feel very competitive 
about it. I would say, especially any game that  

1199
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:59,760
has strategy where you can actually make 
decisions that will really impact the game,  

1200
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,080
there's a lot of games that are just roll the dice 
and it's random chance. It's a little easier not  

1201
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,628
to be competitive about that.
Vanessa: 

1202
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:05,840
Yeah.
Dan: 

1203
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,360
Like when I played shoots and ladders 
with my son the other day, 100% luck,  

1204
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,840
which he didn't necessarily understand. He was 
like, "Look, I'm going to jump over the slide." 

1205
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,064
Vanessa:
You can't jump over the slide. 

1206
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:22,080
Dan:
That's not part of the rules.  

1207
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:29,280
But that was very interesting that he 
thought about that himself. But anyway, yeah,  

1208
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,600
the question is, what am I competitive-
Vanessa: 

1209
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,396
Yeah. Give an example of some games, 
because maybe our students too would like- 

1210
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:35,714
Dan:
What am I super competitive about? 

1211
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:36,880
Vanessa:
Yeah. Maybe they'd like some  

1212
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,240
examples that they could play.
Dan: 

1213
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:44,240
A recent example is there's a game called 
Code Names, and it's one of the best games  

1214
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,000
ever, I think.
Vanessa: 

1215
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,920
Actually, I have a YouTube video where Dan and I 
play this and I teach you how to play it and teach  

1216
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,120
you vocabulary along the way.
Dan: 

1217
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,520
Is very challenging, it scales, 
so if your group is very smart,  

1218
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,680
they'll play it very smart. If your group is 
dumb, it plays to the level of the players.  

1219
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,440
I've had to train myself not to get competitive 
about this game, because for example, we first  

1220
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:17,040
played this. We literally went to bed 
that night and had an argument about it. 

1221
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,800
Vanessa:
"But why did you say this thing?" No,  

1222
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,680
I meant that." "How could you not get this?"
Dan: 

1223
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,040
Yeah. It feels really bad 
to lose that game, I think. 

1224
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,600
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

1225
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,880
Dan:
So, that one really got to me.  

1226
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,560
The last time we played, I have to usually tell 
myself I'm not going to get super competitive.  

1227
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,520
I'm just going to have a good time, and if I 
lose, that's okay. I have to prep myself because  

1228
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,840
I really like to win games.
Vanessa: 

1229
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,360
Yeah. Yeah.
Dan: 

1230
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,600
Actually, I've gotten better with that over time.
Vanessa: 

1231
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,720
Yeah. I think Code Names is a good 
one for English learners. One that  

1232
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:57,840
we play often or we play maybe three 
times a year is Settlers of Catan. 

1233
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,400
Dan:
Yes. 

1234
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,320
Vanessa:
You can play the simple version of sellers  

1235
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,120
of Catan, or you can use the expansions.
Dan: 

1236
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,560
We go a little crazy.
Vanessa: 

1237
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:11,440
The original game, it might take one and a half 
hours, but the way we play, sometimes it takes  

1238
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,680
five hours, and it can be very intense. It depends 
on who you play with. I've played this game with  

1239
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:25,600
people who are so serious that they are not fun 
to play with, as in if you set the dice down,  

1240
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,280
they'll say, "Oh, your turn's over. It's my 
turn now." "What? Give me some slack. Cut  

1241
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,080
me some slack." But when we play with us, and 
the people we usually play with is Dan's sister  

1242
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,280
and her husband, Brad-
Dan: 

1243
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,400
That's the only people we play with now.
Vanessa: 

1244
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,720
Dan rock climbed with, yeah, when we play with 
them, we're all competitive, but we're nice. 

1245
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,240
Dan:
We're lighthearted at the same time. 

1246
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,280
Vanessa:
Yeah. We have a good  

1247
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,600
time still. Sometimes at the end of the game, 
when it's about two o'clock in the morning- 

1248
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,880
Dan:
We've gad arguments though. 

1249
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,760
Vanessa:
Okay. We've had big  

1250
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,040
arguments, the four of us about it. But 
when it's getting really late at night,  

1251
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,960
everyone's really tired, and we know we have to 
wake up early with all of our kids, so it gets a  

1252
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,280
little more stressful. But that's a fun one.
Dan: 

1253
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:05,920
Yes.
Vanessa: 

1254
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
Those are neither-
Dan: 

1255
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,440
You feel competitive about that?
Vanessa: 

1256
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,360
I feel competitive about-
Dan: 

1257
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,040
You're a quiet competitor.
Vanessa: 

1258
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:19,040
I feel competitive about those games, but I 
feel most competitive when I play Carcassonne. 

1259
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,680
Dan:
Oh,  

1260
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,280
just against me?
Vanessa: 

1261
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,063
Against you, mainly because-
Dan: 

1262
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:23,839
You beat me a lot too.
Vanessa: 

1263
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,480
That's why.
Dan: 

1264
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,120
I don't like it.
Vanessa: 

1265
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,440
Because I have probably a 50% chance of winning.  

1266
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:37,920
A lot of games, depending on what they are, if I 
play them with just Dan, I either won't win often  

1267
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,080
or it'll be like 30% of the time I'll win. But 
with Carcassonne, I win about 50% of the time. 

1268
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,120
Dan:
It's not just luck. 

1269
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,640
Vanessa:
It's not just luck. There's a lot of  

1270
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:53,440
work and strategy. If you miss up a move, you 
can lose the entire game, and your three hour  

1271
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,480
experience is lost. I like Carcassonne a lot 
because of that. It's fun to me, I can win. 

1272
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,440
Dan:
We can play one on one. 

1273
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,960
Vanessa:
We can play just us,  

1274
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,156
and I think that's a good... there's not many-
Vanessa: 

1275
01:15:03,156 --> 01:15:05,120
Play just us, and I think that's a good ... 
There's not many good strategy games that you  

1276
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:12,000
can play with just two people. It's based off of 
a city in France, Carcassonne, the same name. And  

1277
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
the game looks like that city.
Dan: 

1278
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,640
You build city walls and roads and stuff.
Vanessa: 

1279
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,200
Yeah. It's quite fun. There's 
also expansions on that.  

1280
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,744
That can make it longer.
Dan: 

1281
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:20,720
Theo would love that game.
Vanessa: 

1282
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,680
I think he could play it.
Dan: 

1283
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,280
Yeah. We got to play that with my son.
Vanessa: 

1284
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,960
Yeah. That'd be fun. Anyway.
Dan: 

1285
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,480
He's going to like games too. We're 
going to get in a lot of family arguments 

1286
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,200
Vanessa:
About being competitive. Actually. He played  

1287
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,320
Settlers of CATAN Jr.
Dan: 

1288
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:34,640
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1289
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,632
Which is the kid's version.
Dan: 

1290
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:36,480
He did amazing. Yesterday.
Vanessa: 

1291
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,520
Yesterday, for the first time 
and you were playing with him. 

1292
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,120
Dan:
I helped him a lot, but he still got it. 

1293
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,720
Vanessa:
Cool. That's a new  

1294
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,440
phase in parenting. When we can-
Dan: 

1295
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:51,360
He's not even five yet and he still sat through 
turns and listened to the rules and he looked at  

1296
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,880
the little chart and figured it out and stuff.
Vanessa: 

1297
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,680
That's cool.
Dan: 

1298
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1299
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,360
That sounds fun. I would-
Dan: 

1300
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,480
It was impressive.
Vanessa: 

1301
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,800
I like little kid stuff, but I really like-
Dan: 

1302
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,307
Big kid stuff.
Vanessa: 

1303
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:06,000
... playing baseball with your kids or playing 
Settlers of CATAN with your kids. Stuff that I  

1304
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,800
enjoy too. Like for example, we're going to an 
aquarium for our five year old's birthday. I like  

1305
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,240
aquariums and this isn't something that's just for 
kids. It's for us too. And it's for his birthday.  

1306
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,211
So a new stage of the ...
Dan: 

1307
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:21,920
The giant critter museum.
Vanessa: 

1308
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,880
That's Dan's favorite.
Dan: 

1309
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,040
Yes.
Vanessa: 

1310
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,680
Anyway, that was a little detour. So I want to 
know for you, what game do you feel competitive  

1311
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:35,680
about? Or maybe you are a non-competitive 
person. You play a game and you're like,  

1312
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:40,720
"I can win. I don't have to win. It's okay." Or 
maybe you are super competitive. Let us know in  

1313
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:45,680
the comments what's a game you feel competitive 
about and we'll go to our next question. Question.  

1314
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:53,360
Number 13 is about celebrities or maybe they 
don't have to be celebrities. Interesting people. 

1315
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,040
Dan:
Famous people. 

1316
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,880
Vanessa:
This is a common- 

1317
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,920
Dan:
Infamous people. 

1318
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,320
Vanessa:
... question, common conversation question  

1319
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:05,520
to spice things up. I'm having a special 
dinner party. Who is someone dead or alive  

1320
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,760
who you would like to invite?
Dan: 

1321
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,120
Yeah, I feel like I've answered 
something similar to this recently. 

1322
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,760
Vanessa:
Oh, okay. 

1323
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,840
Dan:
And I give this answer a lot,  

1324
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,480
so I'm very current. I just want to know 
what's going on in the world now. So I would  

1325
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:24,240
just invite the current president. Okay. So Joe 
Biden, I would actually take Donald Trump too,  

1326
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:31,760
just because I can't believe these people exist 
and are so annoying and dumb. I want to see what  

1327
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:39,920
they're really like. Are they really as ridiculous 
and empty as they seem? Are they faking it? I want  

1328
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,880
to ask them tough questions and see if Joe Biden 
just falls asleep in the middle of dinner, or if  

1329
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,440
Donald Trump just ... I guess he seems pretty ... 
Yeah. He'd probably just blow if he ate something.  

1330
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:56,640
But yeah, I want to get into their heads or try 
to, and just see how ridiculous they are in real  

1331
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,400
life. Because again-
Vanessa: 

1332
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,520
You're just curious.
Dan: 

1333
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:07,200
I live my life and then I see these are the people 
running the country and I just can't put that  

1334
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,564
together and it makes me feel upset usually.
Vanessa: 

1335
01:18:10,564 --> 01:18:12,320
They don't seem like real people.
Dan: 

1336
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,560
Yeah. They're not.
Vanessa: 

1337
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:22,640
So having a dinner conversation with somebody can 
bring out the real them, the real inside look. 

1338
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,280
Dan:
Sure. Oh yeah. That's another key  

1339
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,800
element. I'd get them really drunk.
Vanessa: 

1340
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,040
Okay.
Dan: 

1341
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,360
Got to spike their drinks a little bit 
more. And this is not what I'd really do,  

1342
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,480
but this is the hypothetical world where I get 
Donald Trump at my dinner table or Joe Biden. 

1343
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:38,880
Vanessa:
Okay. 

1344
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,800
Dan:
Joe Biden would just fall asleep. I'm  

1345
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,680
convinced. He's old and just not with it.
Vanessa: 

1346
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,200
Okay. Well.
Dan: 

1347
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,920
But he'd probably share a lot of 
information if you got them tipsy. 

1348
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,280
Vanessa:
That would be very interesting. 

1349
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,320
Dan:
Yeah. Just how close are your fingers  

1350
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,840
to the nuclear buttons, Mr. President?
Vanessa: 

1351
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,880
Do we want to know?
Dan: 

1352
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,920
No.
Vanessa: 

1353
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,120
Well, I feel like for my answer to this 
question, I chose to go much more personal.  

1354
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,040
And that's usually when I think 
about this question, I always  

1355
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,400
think that more.
Dan: 

1356
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,560
This is the difference between you and me.
Vanessa: 

1357
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,760
Yeah. Because if I met with the 
current or past presidents of the US,  

1358
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,120
I don't know what I would do with that 
information. Okay, so this is what they're  

1359
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,640
like now, what do I do?
Dan: 

1360
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,480
Share it to the world.
Vanessa: 

1361
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,360
But I think-
Dan: 

1362
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,400
Nobody'd believe you.
Vanessa: 

1363
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,480
I would be very interested from a personal 
standpoint to meet, on my question number one I  

1364
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:41,280
mentioned Antoinette Menifee, my great grandma who 
came from Italy. I would be very interested to sit  

1365
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,400
down and have a conversation at dinner with her.
Dan: 

1366
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,080
That would be very interesting.
Vanessa: 

1367
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,920
What kind of woman is she 
that she met a random man,  

1368
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:55,200
moved to another country, left her family, 
never saw them again and raised six children in  

1369
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,000
the US? And here we are.
Dan: 

1370
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,640
I have a question.
Vanessa: 

1371
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,520
I'd be very interested.
Dan: 

1372
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,600
Would you go back in time or would she come 
to current time in this hypothetical universe? 

1373
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,720
Vanessa:
She would come to current times. 

1374
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,400
Dan:
So you want to show her the future? 

1375
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,440
Vanessa:
I wouldn't show her  

1376
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,920
anything. I would just be eating dinner with her 
and she would have her entire life experience.  

1377
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,520
Okay. So I don't want her to be like, so 
maybe it doesn't matter 90 years old when she  

1378
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,320
can't remember things, but I don't want her 
to be 30 years old and she hasn't had a lot of  

1379
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,830
experiences yet. So this is a magical question.
Dan: 

1380
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:27,572
60?
Vanessa: 

1381
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,719
I don't know.
Dan: 

1382
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,320
How long did she live, anyways?
Vanessa: 

1383
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,528
I don't know. I met her when I-
Dan: 

1384
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:33,040
You did?
Vanessa: 

1385
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,930
There's a picture of me on her lap as a baby.
Dan: 

1386
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:36,399
Oh.
Vanessa: 

1387
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:42,720
So she lived at least till like 1987, 
1988. I don't know how old she was,  

1388
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,432
but I'm sure she was-
Dan: 

1389
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:44,560
She was probably pretty old.
Vanessa: 

1390
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,520
She had a lot of life experiences and I'm always 
curious about what life was like back then. And  

1391
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,400
I think it would be a personal touch to be 
like, "Oh, this was someone who is part of me  

1392
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,200
and some roots." Anyway, that's 
my answer. So I'm curious for you,  

1393
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:05,120
if you had a magical dinner party, who would you 
like to invite someone dead or alive? Let us know  

1394
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,400
in the comments. I'm curious to see what you 
have to say and let's go to our next question. 

1395
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,560
Vanessa:
The 14th question is about  

1396
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,640
pets. What kind of pet would you like to have?
Dan: 

1397
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,760
What kind of pet? If I could have any pets.
Vanessa: 

1398
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,760
If you could have any pet.
Dan: 

1399
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,440
In the world.
Vanessa: 

1400
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:18,560
Yes.
Dan: 

1401
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,000
That I don't already have.
Vanessa: 

1402
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,040
Well, we have chickens.
Dan: 

1403
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,560
We have cats and chickens.
Vanessa: 

1404
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,000
Tadpoles that turned into frogs, cats. 
Do we have anything else at the moment? 

1405
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,680
Dan:
Well, okay.  

1406
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,240
I can think of one ...
Vanessa: 

1407
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,160
A caterpillar.
Dan: 

1408
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,280
... that does not really fit our family.
Vanessa: 

1409
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:31,600
Okay.
Dan: 

1410
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,880
And it is a smart dog that doesn't bark too much.
Vanessa: 

1411
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,400
Our child hates barking dogs.
Dan: 

1412
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,920
Well, I hate barking too.
Vanessa: 

1413
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:40,240
Yeah.
Dan: 

1414
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:48,160
But I really like dogs to a degree. Certain dogs 
I really like, because I just feel like humans and  

1415
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:54,320
dogs, they really are man's best friend. But when 
I think about how much work a dog takes and it's  

1416
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,280
like almost taking on another family member.
Vanessa: 

1417
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,480
Oh yeah.
Dan: 

1418
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,000
And it just doesn't really fit. Not to mention  

1419
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,080
our oldest son is extremely afraid of dogs.
Vanessa: 

1420
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:06,400
Yeah.
Dan: 

1421
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,080
And he really, really does not like them.
Vanessa: 

1422
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,600
Yeah. If you have any tips about how to help 
kids feel more comfortable with dogs without  

1423
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,595
traumatizing them, I need some help.
Dan: 

1424
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:13,840
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1425
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,960
Let me know in the comments.
Dan: 

1426
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,880
We're working on. It. It's a work in progress.
Vanessa: 

1427
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,600
Yep.
Dan: 

1428
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,120
But also, I don't think you 
like dogs as much as I do. 

1429
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,920
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

1430
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,600
Dan:
I don't think you would put  

1431
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,680
it on a bucket list. It's almost a bucket list 
thing for me to have a dog someday. A cool dog,  

1432
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:37,760
like a Border Collie or an Australian Shepherd. 
Something that's noble, smart, fast, cunning and  

1433
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,760
difficult to keep. Because border collies are 
notorious for needing lots and lots of exercise. 

1434
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,000
Vanessa:
Yeah. If we were farmers,  

1435
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,680
maybe. We worked on a farm.
Dan: 

1436
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,506
We're getting there.
Vanessa: 

1437
01:22:48,506 --> 01:22:53,279
But we have a big garden. We worked on a farm in 
the south of France and they had a Border Collie  

1438
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,800
that was so fun and so smart.
Dan: 

1439
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,200
You could see the intelligence in that dog's eyes.
Vanessa: 

1440
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,000
Oh yeah. That dog was amazing. But that 
dog was living in the perfect place. It had  

1441
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,170
endless stimulation, endless exercise.
Dan: 

1442
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:06,239
Never went inside.
Vanessa: 

1443
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:12,960
That dog could work there. Yeah. It was great. 
But I think it's also smart to know what animals  

1444
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:20,720
don't fit your life. And for us, at least 
at the moment, we have a lot of smart, fast  

1445
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:26,720
running around creatures in our house 
called children. So we're at our capacity. 

1446
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,280
Dan:
Yes. Yeah. And there's also more  

1447
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,440
dogs that I actually dislike than like. There's 
a lot of dogs I'm just like, "No, thank you."  

1448
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,795
Small yippy dogs, no. No, thanks. No.
Vanessa: 

1449
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:38,720
It's not your style.
Dan: 

1450
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,350
Not my thing.
Vanessa: 

1451
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,520
Yeah.
Dan: 

1452
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,800
It'd need to be bigger, smarter, noble, cunning. 
These are the words that come to my mind when I  

1453
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,897
think of a cool dog.
Vanessa: 

1454
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:49,680
Okay, yeah. A dog that helps you in 
some way too. A working dog, maybe. 

1455
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,840
Dan:
Sure. That's not even necessary.  

1456
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,360
Just one that can catch a Frisbee.
Vanessa: 

1457
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,400
Oh, that sounds fun. Cool. Well, 
our kids are getting there.  

1458
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,213
Did you have another one? I thought 
you said you had a second one. 

1459
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:04,880
Dan:
Oh, well, so I also said some fish. 

1460
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,520
Vanessa:
Oh. 

1461
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,720
Dan:
Like a giant fish. 

1462
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,499
Vanessa:
What's giant mean? 

1463
01:24:07,499 --> 01:24:07,753
Dan:
This is- 

1464
01:24:07,753 --> 01:24:08,693
Vanessa:
Like a whale? 

1465
01:24:08,693 --> 01:24:10,000
Dan:
Both of these are unrealistic.  

1466
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,200
Because you said any pet.
Vanessa: 

1467
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,400
Yeah. It's okay. We can dream.
Dan: 

1468
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,720
When you get into the aquarium world. Let me 
tell you about the aquarium world. You can get  

1469
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:24,960
pretty detailed and intense about it. And there 
are some really cool fish. There's one, I think  

1470
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,320
it's called a arowana.
Vanessa: 

1471
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:26,640
Okay.
Dan: 

1472
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,880
I want to say, and they can get like this big.
Vanessa: 

1473
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,600
What kind of tank do you have to have?
Dan: 

1474
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,280
They're shiny and they can be gold or red, 
but they'll literally sell for $10,000. 

1475
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,680
Vanessa:
What? And you probably have to  

1476
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,280
have a tank the size of this room.
Dan: 

1477
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,440
And you need a big tank. Probably 
not the size of the room. 

1478
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,480
Vanessa:
Oh my goodness. 

1479
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,320
Dan:
I wouldn't want to spend money on it.  

1480
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,076
I'd never bring myself to spend money on it.
Vanessa: 

1481
01:24:48,076 --> 01:24:49,320
You can't justify spending money on it.
Dan: 

1482
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:55,520
If somebody just gave me the supplies 
and the fish, I'd set it up and be happy. 

1483
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,200
Vanessa:
Okay. That's a good dream. Yeah. Like my dream. 

1484
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,160
Dan:
Yeah. How about you? 

1485
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:00,760
Vanessa:
I said- 

1486
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,520
Dan:
A dinosaur. 

1487
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,400
Vanessa:
No, I said a cow. 

1488
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,200
Dan:
Oh. 

1489
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,160
Vanessa:
Yeah. I think it would be cool to have a cow, but- 

1490
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:08,960
Dan:
Daisy. 

1491
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,240
Vanessa:
The only way I would have a cow is if basically  

1492
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:21,600
I was just the owner and someone else came every 
day to milk the cow. Somebody prepared, took care  

1493
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,097
of the cow. I don't want to take care of it.
Dan: 

1494
01:25:23,097 --> 01:25:25,360
And in this scenario you're a noble woman.
Vanessa: 

1495
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:25,680
Yes.
Dan: 

1496
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,120
Living in her manor.
Vanessa: 

1497
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,280
Yes. And I would say, "Go take care of my cow 
down there." Basically. I just want lots of milk.  

1498
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:31,920
Lots of milk-
Dan: 

1499
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,427
Free milk.
Vanessa: 

1500
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:35,230
... to make ... It's not free. 
There's a lot of work into a cow. 

1501
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:35,840
Dan:
Okay. Not so free. 

1502
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,200
Vanessa:
I have to pay the person  

1503
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,800
who takes care of the cow.
Dan: 

1504
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,960
You're not touching udders.
Vanessa: 

1505
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:50,960
Having endless amounts of yogurt, cheese, milk, 
that's from your fresh dairy cow. That's cool.  

1506
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,440
But it's also extremely hard.
Dan: 

1507
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,040
They poop all over your yard.
Vanessa: 

1508
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,413
Well, I don't even need to keep it in my yard.
Dan: 

1509
01:25:57,413 --> 01:25:58,000
So do the chickens. Oh.
Vanessa: 

1510
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,520
It would be on my farm. 

1511
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,560
Dan:
Oh. 

1512
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,120
Vanessa:
It would be  

1513
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,680
in someone else's farm and 
I would just own that cow. 

1514
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,493
Dan:
On your manor. 

1515
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:05,440
Vanessa:
But there's actually,  

1516
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:11,200
I was thinking about this the other day, we stayed 
at an Airbnb that was a farm and they have some  

1517
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:20,080
cows and horses and chickens and they have a milk 
sharing program where you can buy part of the cow.  

1518
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:25,200
So you're not actually like I buy the leg of the 
cow, that kind of thing. They're saying, if you  

1519
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,560
buy part of the cow, the ownership of this 
cow, you will get a certain amount of milk  

1520
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,040
per month from that cow. 
So it's what I'm thinking.  

1521
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:43,520
You don't have to do any work, but you get the 
milk. Yeah. And you pay for it. But it's local  

1522
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:49,600
and it's going back to justifying, spending 
more money on high quality animal products. 

1523
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,280
Dan:
We could just do that. 

1524
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,440
Vanessa:
We eat a lot of yogurt and I hate  

1525
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,800
to buy all the yogurt. We buy a bulk big yogurt 
container, but we go through so many of those.  

1526
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,813
We eat yogurt a lot. Our kids eat yogurt a lot.
Dan: 

1527
01:27:00,813 --> 01:27:01,440
Our kids love yogurt.
Vanessa: 

1528
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:10,160
Yeah. I think that if we had something 
like a milk sharing program, we would,  

1529
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,400
or I would be more inclined to just make some 
yogurt in the Crockpot or something and have  

1530
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,160
that at home. Anyway.
Dan: 

1531
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,600
That's a very Vanessa answer.
Vanessa: 

1532
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,709
That's a dream.
Dan: 

1533
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:21,200
A cow that you don't want to take care of.
Vanessa: 

1534
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,480
No, I don't want to take care of it.
Dan: 

1535
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,840
Those people that had the cow at the 
Airbnb, they looked really tired. 

1536
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,440
Vanessa:
They said- 

1537
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,840
Dan:
They had three cows,  

1538
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,400
two cows?
Vanessa: 

1539
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:36,240
They said the word we would use to describe having 
a cow is relentless. They said rain or shine,  

1540
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,108
sick or not.
Dan: 

1541
01:27:37,108 --> 01:27:37,600
You got to milk them.
Vanessa: 

1542
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:43,200
Christmas or Thanksgiving, any day, twice a day, 
they have to go to the barn and milk that cow. 

1543
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,720
Dan:
Yeah. And it's just two people there. 

1544
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,560
Vanessa:
Yeah. They didn't hire anyone to  

1545
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,720
help them, so they never get a vacation, which 
they could hire someone to help occasionally. 

1546
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,680
Dan:
I will just say- 

1547
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:51,750
Vanessa:
Anyway. Not my style. 

1548
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,480
Dan:
I saw a twinge of regret in her eyes  

1549
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,160
when she was talking about this decision.
Vanessa: 

1550
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,600
Yeah. They loved those cows and they took 
good care of them. But they're like, "Oh,  

1551
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,240
this is relentless."
Dan: 

1552
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:05,360
Yeah. Because in their previous life, they 
weren't ... Well life. Jobs or careers,  

1553
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,800
they weren't farmers at all.
Vanessa: 

1554
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,520
Yeah.
Dan: 

1555
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,000
They made a conscious decision to go back to  

1556
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,640
farming.
Vanessa: 

1557
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,240
Yeah. Anyway, that's my answer, a cow.
Dan: 

1558
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,360
That could be you.
Vanessa: 

1559
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,600
That could be me. We'll see. 
Anyway, what about you? What pet,  

1560
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,400
if you could have any pet in the world, or any 
animal really, it doesn't even have to be a pet,  

1561
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,840
what would you have? Let us know in the comments. 
And we'll go to our final question. Are you ready? 

1562
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,640
Dan:
Ready. 

1563
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,960
Vanessa:
Let's go. The final question. Question number 15.  

1564
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,920
We've made it this far is about books. 
Something that's a love of my life. The  

1565
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,608
question is-
Dan: 

1566
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:43,520
And not as much mine.
Vanessa: 

1567
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,440
Yeah, so I'm very curious what 
you have to say about this.  

1568
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,200
What is a book that you would recommend 
everyone read because you loved it so much? 

1569
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,640
Dan:
Yeah. My answer's definitely a cop out here. 

1570
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,200
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

1571
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,560
Dan:
Because I don't read that much. And  

1572
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,920
the most I ever read, we had a book club and it 
basically required me to read. And I like reading  

1573
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,440
a lot. I just don't do it. I find myself listening 
to something or watching something first.  

1574
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,440
So my cop out answer is some parenting book.
Vanessa: 

1575
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,560
Oh, okay.
Dan: 

1576
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,440
So the one that comes to my mind is called 
Peaceful Parenting, but I don't think it  

1577
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:32,080
specifically has to be that. It just has to be 
something that is not too modern, but not just  

1578
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:38,480
handed down generationally, like, "I just do what 
my parents did." Something intentional, training  

1579
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:46,400
people basically how to be better, kinder, gentler 
parents for their children. How to talk to them  

1580
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:54,400
better. There's a lot of strategies and tips you 
can get for talking about or talking to children.  

1581
01:29:54,400 --> 01:30:01,440
And the book also needs to have like a lot 
of what's that child psychology informing it  

1582
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:07,040
scientifically because the more you learn about 
children, the more you learn that they are  

1583
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:13,280
developing at different times and rates and 
you might think they can handle something,  

1584
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,840
but in reality, their brains literally can't 
handle it. So that gives you more patience. 

1585
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,240
Vanessa:
Yeah. 

1586
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,440
Dan:
Because there's a lot of people,  

1587
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:25,520
a lot of parents who just think their kids are 
stubborn or just want to yell at them for things,  

1588
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,040
but they don't really get the full picture 
about the child's development and their needs. 

1589
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,436
Vanessa:
Yeah. Yeah. 

1590
01:30:31,437 --> 01:30:33,120
Dan:
So that's my answer even though  

1591
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,146
it's not really one specific book.
Vanessa: 

1592
01:30:35,146 --> 01:30:35,679
Don't worry.
Dan: 

1593
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:41,440
I have other books that I really enjoyed, but 
maybe aren't as relevant to people. One that came  

1594
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,520
to my mind is called Educated.
Vanessa: 

1595
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,840
Oh, that was an interesting book. Yeah.
Dan: 

1596
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:52,480
But that feels really relevant to me because I was 
homeschooled. And so this girl was homeschooled,  

1597
01:30:52,480 --> 01:31:02,080
but in a really bad environment. And so it's that 
story basically of being extremely sheltered. And  

1598
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,360
basically even in that terrible environment, 
there's almost pros and cons to it.  

1599
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,120
It almost made her stronger in some 
ways, even though it was awful. 

1600
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,040
Vanessa:
That's an interesting story. 

1601
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,480
Dan:
That was a very interesting book to me. 

1602
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,800
Vanessa:
Yeah. I would say for the parenting books,  

1603
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,960
I have an Amazon link.
Dan: 

1604
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,080
She's got a list for you.
Vanessa: 

1605
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:31,440
I do. It's a Speak English With Vanessa Amazon 
book storefront. So I've chosen a bunch of books  

1606
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:36,240
that I recommend because I've made a lot of videos 
about books on this channel. So in the description  

1607
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:41,360
of this video, you can see the Amazon link for 
my book recommendations and there's different  

1608
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:46,000
folders. There's children's books, there's 
beginner English books. If you've never read  

1609
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,360
a book in English before, this is what I recommend 
reading there's intermediate books, there's  

1610
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,040
nonfiction books.
Vanessa: 

1611
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:59,680
And in that children's book section are books for 
children, but also parenting book recommendations  

1612
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:05,680
that have really impacted us and have been 
useful in our lives. For example, a book called  

1613
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:11,520
Hunt, Gather, Parent. There's another book 
called Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids. And if you  

1614
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:18,000
have more than one child Peaceful Parent, Happy 
Siblings is amazing. We've read a lot of these  

1615
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,600
styles of books. And I think it's just changing 
your mindset about how to respect your child,  

1616
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,680
but also still be the authority.
Dan: 

1617
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,000
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1618
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,659
Anyway, like Dan said-
Dan: 

1619
01:32:26,659 --> 01:32:27,204
It's a tough balance.
Vanessa: 

1620
01:32:27,204 --> 01:32:31,040
... some psychology as well. So there's a 
lot of recommendations. If you click on that  

1621
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:36,880
Amazon link and you would like to dive into the 
world of a better relationship with your child, 

1622
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,480
Dan:
Especially if you got kids out there. 

1623
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,200
Vanessa:
Oh yeah. Or you are interacting with children.  

1624
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:49,280
Anyway, it's very insightful. My recommendation 
was also on a similar nonfiction route. Because  

1625
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:55,040
I've read a lot of fiction that's personally 
made me feel passionate about different topics.  

1626
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,440
And I love reading fiction and diving into 
different worlds, especially historical  

1627
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,640
fiction where you're learning about something in 
history. But I would say the book that made me  

1628
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,720
within the last two years, the 
most passionate, can you guess? 

1629
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,440
Dan:
Something about Native Americans? 

1630
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,200
Vanessa:
No, I do read a lot about native Americans  

1631
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,800
though. Is a book called Digital Minimalism.
Dan: 

1632
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,800
Oh yeah. I thought you were talking fiction.
Vanessa: 

1633
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:21,600
Yes. Which is-
Dan: 

1634
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,240
Or nonfiction.
Vanessa: 

1635
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,760
Oh, this one is not fiction.
Dan: 

1636
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,960
This is nonfiction.
Vanessa: 

1637
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,920
It's ironic because we are here 
sharing this on social media. 

1638
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,089
Dan:
Yeah. 

1639
01:33:28,089 --> 01:33:30,480
Vanessa:
But if you feel like you  

1640
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:40,000
look at your phone too much, or if you feel like, 
"Why did it seem like life was so much more simple  

1641
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,640
in the 1990s?"
Dan: 

1642
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,188
It was.
Vanessa: 

1643
01:33:43,188 --> 01:33:49,040
This is a wonderful book to read, Digital 
Minimalism. It confirmed everything that I  

1644
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:55,680
suspected or that I thought about, especially 
about phones, but about media in general. 

1645
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,045
Dan:
Technology. 

1646
01:33:56,045 --> 01:33:58,080
Vanessa:
But it gave a better  

1647
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:04,000
plan for what to do because you can't just 
cut out YouTube from your life. I need- 

1648
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,280
Dan:
I don't know about that. 

1649
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,920
Vanessa:
You can't cut out Vanessa's videos. When I need  

1650
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:13,040
to, for example, do something with the garden, 
what do I do when I don't know? I Google it. I  

1651
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:18,400
watch a YouTube video. It's very useful in many 
ways, say for education or even for entertainment,  

1652
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,840
but this book helps you to have a good plan so 
that you are the one in control of your media use.  

1653
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:32,080
It's not just social media. It could be watching 
the news all the time. It could be listening to  

1654
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,040
podcasts all the time, whatever it is. I feel 
like this book helped me to create a better  

1655
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:43,280
plan for myself so that I felt more in control. 
So I highly recommend this book because I feel  

1656
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:50,588
like it's ubiquitous that everyone, especially if 
you're watching this on YouTube in some way ... 

1657
01:34:50,588 --> 01:34:51,090
Dan:
Struggles. 

1658
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:54,800
Vanessa:
... uses technology more than they would like. 

1659
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,560
Dan:
Yeah. 

1660
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,120
Vanessa:
And technology's not a bad thing. 

1661
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:57,487
Dan:
It's a modern problem. 

1662
01:34:57,487 --> 01:34:59,680
Vanessa:
Yeah. It's just something that can easily  

1663
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,000
get out of hand, which is a great expression.
Dan: 

1664
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,560
So do you have any fiction books though?
Vanessa: 

1665
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,440
Oh yes. But that is ...
Dan: 

1666
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,011
Recommendations?
Vanessa: 

1667
01:35:06,011 --> 01:35:07,274
... a whole nother rabbit hole.
Dan: 

1668
01:35:07,275 --> 01:35:07,520
Yeah.
Vanessa: 

1669
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,280
I would recommend if you want to read-
Dan: 

1670
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,800
We didn't mention fiction.
Vanessa: 

1671
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:11,044
Yeah.
Dan: 

1672
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:12,400
You got to say one thing at least.
Vanessa: 

1673
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:17,120
Well, I do recommend watching my videos 
about fiction book recommendations. 

1674
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,320
Dan:
She's got a whole video  

1675
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,328
about it right here.
Vanessa: 

1676
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:20,160
I have four videos.
Dan: 

1677
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:20,800
Or is it here?
Vanessa: 

1678
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,280
Three videos I think so far about book 
recommendations. If you would like to  

1679
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,760
watch my video about books to learn about 
America. So they're American books about American  

1680
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:38,640
culture or they're books that are popular 
about the US. There's books I mentioned about  

1681
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,920
beginner English books. If you've never read a 
book in English before I made a video about those.  

1682
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:49,120
Nonfiction books, I think I did an advanced 
book video as well. There are a lot. So I  

1683
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,440
will put those links in the description. Please 
dive into that if you're interested in reading.  

1684
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,200
It's something I'm passionate about, so 
I'm always happy to share more about it.  

1685
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:03,440
And I'm glad this last question was something 
that is so exciting for me. Yes. Well,  

1686
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:07,840
thank you so much everyone for 
joining us today for this very,  

1687
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,280
very long conversation.
Dan: 

1688
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,880
Yes. We hope you enjoyed it.
Vanessa: 

1689
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,760
Yes. I hope that you enjoyed it. I hope that you 
can dive into it a little bit deeper if you would  

1690
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:24,800
like to download the free MP3. I mean not MP3, 
PDF. It's been a long morning making this video.  

1691
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,640
If you would like to download the free PDF 
worksheet for this video, there is a link in  

1692
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:34,320
the description. You'll get access to all of the 
questions, some of the key sentences that we said,  

1693
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:42,240
and if all goes well, next week I will be making a 
video specifically focusing on some key vocabulary  

1694
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,280
from this video. We'll expand. I'll be explaining-
Dan: 

1695
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,880
Dive into our ramblings.
Vanessa: 

1696
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,680
Yes. Explaining some of the key expressions that 
we talked about in this video. Not all of them,  

1697
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:58,720
but the ones that I deem the most important. 
So stay tuned next week. You can download the  

1698
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:04,480
PDF today and then join me next week to dive into 
the vocabulary a little deeper. Well, thanks Dan. 

1699
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,080
Dan:
You're welcome. 

1700
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,000
Vanessa:
This has been a journey this morning. 

1701
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,040
Dan:
Many questions. 

1702
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,517
Vanessa:
Many questions. 

1703
01:37:09,517 --> 01:37:12,720
Dan:
Many answers. Did we solve the meaning of life? 

1704
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,440
Vanessa:
Oh, that's a  

1705
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,146
good question. Let us know. Do you think we solved 
the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? 

1706
01:37:17,146 --> 01:37:19,040
Dan:
I think we did as best we could. 

1707
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,120
Vanessa:
If you made it to the end of this video,  

1708
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,920
I would like to give you a little ...
Dan: 

1709
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,800
High five.
Vanessa: 

1710
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,120
A high five, and also a little surprise.
Dan: 

1711
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,160
Oh.
Vanessa: 

1712
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,400
If you made it to the end of this video 
in the comments, I want you to write  

1713
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:42,720
blue water bottle. And when I see that in the 
comments, I'll know you finished this video  

1714
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,720
because you wrote blue water bottle.
Dan: 

1715
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,240
You saw the blue water bottle.
Vanessa: 

1716
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,640
Oh, it's here. Okay. Well that's our little 
secret nugget at the end of this video. Thank  

1717
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:56,320

Dan: 

1719
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,960
Bye.
Vanessa: 

1720
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,400

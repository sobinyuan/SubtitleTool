1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,318
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with. Come on.

2
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,072
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,476
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,153
So does he have a hump,a hump and a hair piece?

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,159
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,437
I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl.

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,560
Okay,everybody relax. This is not even a date.

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,348
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,038
Sounds like a date to me.

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,918
I'm back in high school,in the middle of the cafeteria,and I realize I'm totally naked.

11
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,795
Yeah. I've had that dream.

12
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:29,159
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone there.

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,677
Instead of... That's right!That one,I've never had. No.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,312
All of a sudden,the phone starts to ring.

15
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,516
And it turns out it's my mother.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,312
Which is very,very weird because she never calls me.

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,959
Hi.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,955
This guy says hello,I wanna kill myself.

19
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,357
Are you okay,sweetie?

20
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,000
I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine,pulled it out of my mouth,and tied it around my neck. Cookie?

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,754
Carol moved her stuff out today.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,436
Let me get you some coffee. Thanks.

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,356
No. No,don't!Stop cleansing my aura.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,638
Just leave my aura alone,okay?

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,971
I'll be fine. All right? Really.

26
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,960
I hope she'll be very happy. No,you don't. No,I don't. To hell with her.

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,559
She left me!And you never knew she was a lesbian.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,718
No!Okay?

29
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,359
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,596
She didn't know. How should I know?

31
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,919
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

32
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,398
Did I say that out loud?

33
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,316
All right,Ross. Look,you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting.

34
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,468
Can I tell you what the answer is?

35
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,439
Strip joints!

36
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,074
Come on,you're single. Have some hormones.

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,914
See,but I don't want to be single,okay?

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,316
I just wanna be married again.

39
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,878
And I just want a million dollars!

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,439
Rachel? Oh,God,Monica!Hi!Thank God!

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,709
I went to your building and this guy with a big hammer said that you might be here,and you are.

42
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,315
Can I get you some coffee? Decaf.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay,everybody,this is Rachel,another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,878
This is Chandler and Phoebe,and Joey. And remember my brother,Ross? Sure!Hey.Hi. Oh,God.

45
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,792
So you wanna tell us now,or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,909
Oh,God!It started about a half hour before the wedding.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,316
I was in this room with all the presents,and I was looking at this gravy boat.

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,677
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?

49
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,469
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,875
Then I got really freaked out,and that's when it hit me:

51
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,839
How much Barry looks like Mr.Potato Head.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
I always knew he looked familiar,but...

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,355
Anyway,I just had to get out of there,and I started wondering:

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,235
Why am I doing this?And Who am I doing this for?

55
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,198
Anyway,I just didn't know where to go,and I know you and I have drifted apart,

56
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,514
but you're the only person I know in the city.Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,278
I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

58
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,194
I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ,

59
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:18,073
and she's really not happy about it.Daddy,I just...I can't marry him.I'm sorry.

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,558
I just don't love him.

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,516
It matters to me.

62
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,279
She should not be wearing those pants.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,912
I say push her down the stairs.Push her down the stairs!

64
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:49,994
Come on,Daddy,listen to me! It's like all of my life,everyone's always told me,You're a shoe!Then today I stopped and said,

65
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:55,799
What if I don't wanna be a shoe?What if I wanna be a purse?You know?Or a hat?

66
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,314
I don't want you to buy me a hat,I am a hat.It's a metaphor,Daddy!

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,995
You can see where he'd have trouble.

68
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,277
Look,Daddy,it's my life.Maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:29,277
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.Maybe that's my decision.Maybe I don't need your money.Wait! I said maybe!

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,638
Okay.Just breathe,that's it.Just try to think of nice,calm things.

71
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,876
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,636
La la la something With string I'm all better now.

73
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,799
I helped.

74
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,619
Look,this is probably for the best,

75
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:08,264
you know?Independence.Taking control of your life.And if you need anything,you can always

76
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:12,867
come to Joey.Me and Chandler live right across the hall.And he's away a lot.

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,755
Joey,stop hitting on her.It's her wedding day.What?Like there's a rule or something?

78
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:29,917
Please don't do that again.It's a horrible sound.It's Paul.Buzz him in.Who's Paul?Paul,the wine guy,Paul?

79
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:36,214
Maybe.Wait a minute.Your not a real date is with Paul,the wine guy?He finally asked you out?

80
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,159
Yes.This is a Dear Diary moment.

81
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,192
Rach,wait,I can cancel.Please,no.Go,I'll be fine.

82
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:53,599
Ross,are you okay?Do you want me to stay?That'd be good.Really?No,go on!It's Paul, the wine guy.

83
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,519
Hi,come in.Paul,this is everybody.Everybody,this is Paul.Paul,the wine guy.

84
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Wine guy.I didn't catch your name.Paul,was it?Okay.Sit down.Two seconds.Okay.

85
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
I just pulled out four eyelashes.That can't be good.

86
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,089
So,Rachel,what are you up to tonight?I

87
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,120
was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon,so,nothing.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,519
Right.You're not even getting your honeymoon.God.No.Although,Aruba.This time of year?Talk about your...

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
big lizards.

90
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,195
Anyway,if you don't feel like being alone tonight,Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

91
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,960
Yes,and we're very excited about it.Actually,thanks,but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.

92
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,578
It's been a long day.Sure.Okay.Sure.Pheebs,you wanna help?

93
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,428
I wish I could,but I don't want to.

94
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,399
I'm supposed to attach a bracket y thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys.

95
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,200
I have no bracket y thing,I see no worm guys whatsoever,and I cannot feel my legs.

96
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,795
What's this?I have no idea.

97
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,919
Done with the bookcase.All finished.

98
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,395
This was Carol's favorite beer.

99
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,799
She always drank it out of the can.I should have known.

100
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:54,644
Hey.Ross,let me ask you a question.She got the furniture,the stereo,the good TV.What did you get?

101
00:09:54,644 --> 00:10:01,834
You guys.Oh,God.You got screwed.Oh,my God.I know.I'm such an idiot.

102
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,074
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.

103
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,840
How clean can teeth get?My brother's going through that.He's such a mess.

104
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,154
How did you get through it?He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.

105
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,679
Say her...Leg?That's one way of going through it,yeah.Me,I went for the watch.

106
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,480
You actually broke her watch?Barry,I'm sorry.I am so sorry.

107
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:36,317
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on,but it isn't. It isn't,it's about me.And I...

108
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,997
Hi.Machine cut me off again. Anyway...

109
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,840
You know what's scary?What if there's only one woman for everybody?

110
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:59,597
What if you get one woman,and that's it?Unfortunately,in my case,there was only one woman for her.

111
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,479
What are you talking about?One woman.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,633
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.

113
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,912
Let me tell you something,Ross.There's lots of flavors out there.

114
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,591
There's Rocky Road and Cookie Dough and Bing Cherry Vanilla.You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

115
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,315
This is the best thing that ever happened to you.You got married.You were like,what,8?

116
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,771
Welcome back to the world.

117
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:36,636
Grab a spoon.I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.Then stay out of my freezer.

118
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,673
Ever since she walked out on me,I...What?You wanna spell it out with noodles?

119
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,717
No,it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.So there's gonna be a fifth date?

120
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:02,875
Isn't there?Yeah.I think there is.What were you gonna say?

121
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:15,356
Well...Ever since she left me,I haven't been able to perform sexually.

122
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,216
Oh,God!I am so...I'm so sorry.

123
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:24,990
It's okay.Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

124
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,199
How long?Two years.

125
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

126
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,475
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

127
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,557
Yeah.Yeah,I do.

128
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,919
I,Joanie,take you,Charles,as my lawful husband.

129
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,515
Do you take Joanie... See.But Joanie loved Chachi.That's the difference.

130
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Grab a spoon.

131
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,033
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

132
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,229
Do the words,Billy,don't be a hero,mean anything to you?

133
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Here's the thing.

134
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,109
Even if I could get it together enough to ask a woman out

135
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,077
who am I gonna ask?

136
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Isn't this amazing?I have never made coffee before in my life. That is amazing.Congratulations.

137
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,512
While you're on a roll,if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...

138
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,639
Although,actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.

139
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,519
Good morning. Good morning. Morning. Morning.

140
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,717
Morning. Morning,Paul. Hello,Paul. Hi. Paul,is it?

141
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,278
I had a really great time last night. Thank you. Thank you so much.

142
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,915
We'll talk later,okay? Yeah.

143
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,359
Thank you.

144
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,158
That wasn't a real date.

145
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,630
What the hell do you do on a real date?

146
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,872
Shut up and put my table back. Okay.

147
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,959
All right,kids,I gotta get to work.

148
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,359
If I don't input those numbers,it doesn't make much of a difference.

149
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,195
So,like,you guys all have jobs?

150
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,834
Yeah,we all have jobs. See,that's how we buy stuff.

151
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:07,039
Yeah,I'm an actor. Would I have seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

152
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,472
Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

153
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,157
Look,Geppeto.I'm a real live boy.

154
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,600
I will not take this abuse. You're right.I'm sorry.

155
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,592
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy

156
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,159
So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

157
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,633
I can see that.You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

158
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,036
I know.He's just so...

159
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,559
Remember you and Tony De Marco? Yeah.It's like that.With feelings.

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
Are you in trouble!

161
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,396
Okay.I am just going to get up,go to work,and not think about him all day.

162
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,793
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

163
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,079
Wish me luck! What for?

164
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,234
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

165
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,559
Hey,Monica. Hey,Franny. Welcome back. How was Florida? You had sex,didn't you?

166
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,838
How do you do that?

167
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,958
So,who? You know Paul?

168
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,676
Paul,the wine guy? Yeah,I know Paul.

169
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,076
You mean,you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

170
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,035
Before me,there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

171
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,600
Of course it was a line.

172
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,758
Why?Why would anybody do something like that?

173
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,875
We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:To get you into bed.

174
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,113
Is it me?Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs,

175
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,839
and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

176
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,680
All right,come here.Give me your feet.

177
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,954
I just thought he was nice,you know?

178
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,874
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

179
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,077
Guess what.You got a job?Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.

180
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,639
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today. Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

181
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,200
You would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale 50 percent off.

182
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,759
How well you know me.

183
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,999
They're my new I don't need a job or my parents. I've got great boots boots.

184
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,435
How'd you pay for them?Credit card.

185
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,199
And who pays for that?My father.

186
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,627
You can't live off your parents your whole life.I know that.

187
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:06,400
That's why I was getting married.

188
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,479
Give her a break.It's hard being on your own for the first time. Thank you.You're welcome.

189
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,232
I remember when I first came to this city,I was 14.

190
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,155
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.

191
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,271
And I got here,and I didn't know anybody.

192
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:27,078
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself.

193
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,757
And then I found aromatherapy.

194
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,119
So believe me,I know exactly how you feel.

195
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,119
The word you're looking for is:Anyway...

196
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,679
All right.You ready?I don't think so. Come on.Cut.Cut.

197
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:59,799
Hey.All right.Welcome to the real world.It sucks. You're gonna love it.

198
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,599
That's it. You gonna crash on the couch?No.No,I gotta go home sometime. Are you gonna be okay?Yeah.

199
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,400
Look what I just found on the floor.

200
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
What?That's Paul's watch.

201
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,440
You can just put it back where you found it.

202
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,038
Oh,boy.All right.Good night,everybody. Good night.

203
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,318
Sorry.No.Go.No,have it,really. Split it?Okay.Okay.

204
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,240
Thanks.

205
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,712
You probably didn't know this,but back in high school I had a major crush on you.

206
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,078
I knew.You did?

207
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,592
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.

208
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,598
I did.

209
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,960
Listen,do you think...And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.

210
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,672
Do you think it would be okay if I ask you out sometime,maybe?

211
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,319
Yeah.Maybe.

212
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,039
Okay.

213
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,958
Okay,maybe I will.

214
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,797
Good night.Good night.

215
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
See you.

216
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,398
Wait.What's with you?

217
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,158
I just grabbed a spoon.

218
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,771
Can't believe what I'm hearing.I can't believe What I'm hearing here What?

219
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:25,400
I said you had...What?I said you had...Would you stop?Was I doing it again? Yes.

220
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,755
Would anybody like more coffee?

221
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,072
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

222
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,234
I'm just serving it.I'll have a cup of coffee.

223
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,839
Kids,new dream.I'm in Las Vegas.I'm Liza Minnelli.

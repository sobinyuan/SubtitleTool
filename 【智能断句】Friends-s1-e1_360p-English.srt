1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,318
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with. Come on.

2
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,072
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,476
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,976
So does he have a hump,

5
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,153
a hump and a hair piece?

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,159
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

7
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,045
I don't want her to go through

8
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:04,437
what I went through with Carl.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,560
Okay,everybody relax. This is not even a date.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,348
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,038
Sounds like a date to me.

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,958
I'm back in high school,

13
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,515
in the middle of the cafeteria,

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,918
and I realize I'm totally naked.

15
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,795
Yeah. I've had that dream.

16
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:29,159
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone there.

17
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,879
Instead of... That's right!

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,312
That one,I've never had. No. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

19
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,516
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,312
Which is very,very weird because she never calls me.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,959
Hi.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,955
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.

23
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,357
Are you okay,sweetie?

24
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,116
I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine,

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,456
pulled it out of my mouth,

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,000
and tied it around my neck. Cookie?

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,754
Carol moved her stuff out today.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,436
Let me get you some coffee. Thanks.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,356
No. No,don't! Stop cleansing my aura.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,638
Just leave my aura alone,okay?

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,971
I'll be fine. All right? Really.

32
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:30,680
I hope she'll be very happy. No,you don't. No,I don't. To hell with her. She left me!

33
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,559
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,718
No! Okay?

35
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,359
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,596
She didn't know. How should I know?

37
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,919
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

38
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,398
Did I say that out loud?

39
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,316
All right,Ross. Look,you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting.

40
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,468
Can I tell you what the answer is?

41
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,439
Strip joints!

42
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,074
Come on,you're single. Have some hormones.

43
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,914
See,but I don't want to be single,okay?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,316
I just wanna be married again.

45
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,878
And I just want a million dollars!

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,960
Rachel? Oh,God,Monica! Hi! Thank God! I went to your building

47
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,709
and this guy with a big hammer said that you might be here, and you are.

48
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,315
Can I get you some coffee? Decaf.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,878
Okay,everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe, and Joey. And remember my brother,Ross? Sure! Hey. Hi. Oh,God.

50
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,865
So you wanna tell us now,

51
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,792
or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

52
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,909
Oh,God! It started about a half hour before the wedding.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,398
I was in this room with all the presents,

54
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,316
and I was looking at this gravy boat.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,677
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?

56
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,614
I realized I was more turned on

57
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:23,469
by this gravy boat than by Barry.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,496
Then I got really freaked out,

59
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,875
and that's when it hit me:

60
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,839
How much Barry looks like Mr.Potato Head.

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
I always knew he looked familiar, but...

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,355
Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,339
Why am I doing this?

64
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,653
And Who am I doing this for? Anyway,

65
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,156
I just didn't know where to go,

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,198
and I know you and I have drifted apart,

67
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,633
but you're the only person I know in the city.

68
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,514
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,278
I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

70
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,194
I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ,

71
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,798
and she's really not happy about it.

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,073
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,558
I just don't love him.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,516
It matters to me.

75
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,279
She should not be wearing those pants.

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,912
I say push her down the stairs. Push her down the stairs!

77
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,799
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

78
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:48,473
It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, You're a shoe!

79
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,994
Then today I stopped and said,

80
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,746
What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

81
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,799
What if I wanna be a purse? You know? Or a hat?

82
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,314
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat. It's a metaphor, Daddy!

83
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,995
You can see where he'd have trouble.

84
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,635
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,277
Maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,556
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Maybe that's my decision.

88
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,277
Maybe I don't need your money. Wait! I said maybe!

89
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,976
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

90
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,638
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,516
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens

92
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,876
Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,477
La la la something With string

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,636
I'm all better now.

95
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,799
I helped.

96
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,117
Look, this is probably for the best, you know?

97
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,135
Independence. Taking control of your life. And if you need anything,

98
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,393
you can always come to Joey.

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,867
Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,191
Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.

101
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,755
What? Like there's a rule or something?

102
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,317
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound. It's Paul. Buzz him in.

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,917
Who's Paul? Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

104
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:36,439
Maybe. Wait a minute. Your not a real date is with Paul, the wine guy? He finally asked you out? Yes.

105
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,159
This is a Dear Diary moment.

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,883
Rach, wait, I can cancel. Please, no. Go, I'll be fine. Ross, are you okay?

107
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,753
Do you want me to stay?

108
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,637
That'd be good.

109
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,599
Really? No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

110
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,715
Hi, come in. Paul, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,040
Paul, the wine guy. Wine guy. I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

112
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,040
Okay. Sit down. Two seconds. Okay.

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

114
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,239
So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?

115
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,120
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so, nothing.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,033
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.

117
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,519
God. No. Although, Aruba. This time of year? Talk about your...

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
big lizards.

119
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,316
Anyway,if you don't feel like being alone tonight,

120
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,195
Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

121
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,399
Yes,and we're very excited about it.

122
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,578
Actually,thanks,but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been a long day. Sure.Okay.Sure. Pheebs,you wanna help?

123
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,428
I wish I could,but I don't want to.

124
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,717
I'm supposed to attach a bracket y thing to the side things

125
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,399
using a bunch of these little worm guys.

126
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I have no bracket y thing,

127
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,240
I see no worm guys whatsoever,

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,200
and I cannot feel my legs.

129
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,795
What's this?I have no idea.

130
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,919
Done with the bookcase. All finished.

131
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,395
This was Carol's favorite beer.

132
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,799
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

133
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,356
Hey.Ross,let me ask you a question.

134
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,516
She got the furniture,the stereo,the good TV.

135
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,838
What did you get?You guys. Oh,God.You got screwed.

136
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,834
Oh,my God.I know. I'm such an idiot.

137
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,306
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist

138
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:11,840
four and five times a week. How clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.

139
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,635
How did you get through it?

140
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,840
He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers. Say her...Leg?

141
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,675
That's one way of going through it,yeah.

142
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,679
Me,I went for the watch.

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,915
You actually broke her watch?

144
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Barry,I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

145
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:36,317
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't. It isn't,it's about me. And I...

146
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,997
Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...

147
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,840
You know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?

148
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,197
What if you get one woman,and that's it?

149
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,597
Unfortunately,in my case,there was only one woman for her.

150
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,479
What are you talking about? One woman.

151
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,316
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something,Ross.

152
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:10,912
There's lots of flavors out there.

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
There's Rocky Road and Cookie Dough and Bing Cherry Vanilla.

154
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,591
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

155
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,315
This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married. You were like,what,8?

156
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,195
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

157
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,636
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

158
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,636
Then stay out of my freezer.

159
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,552
Ever since she walked out on me,I...

160
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,673
What?You wanna spell it out with noodles?

161
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,035
No,it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.

162
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,717
So there's gonna be a fifth date?

163
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,080
Isn't there? Yeah.I think there is.

164
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,875
What were you gonna say?

165
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,319
Well...Ever since she left me,

166
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,356
I haven't been able to perform sexually.

167
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,798
Oh,God!I am so... I'm so sorry. It's okay.

168
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,990
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,479
How long?

170
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,199
Two years.

171
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

172
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,475
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

173
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,519
Yeah.

174
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,557
Yeah,I do.

175
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,919
I,Joanie,take you,Charles, as my lawful husband.

176
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,515
Do you take Joanie... See. But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.

177
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Grab a spoon.

178
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,033
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

179
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,229
Do the words,Billy,don't be a hero,mean anything to you?

180
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Here's the thing.

181
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,109
Even if I could get it together enough to ask a woman out

182
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,077
who am I gonna ask?

183
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Isn't this amazing? I have never made coffee before in my life. That is amazing. Congratulations. While you're on a roll,

184
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,512
if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...

185
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,639
Although,actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.

186
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,519
Good morning. Good morning. Morning. Morning.

187
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,717
Morning. Morning,Paul. Hello,Paul. Hi. Paul,is it?

188
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,278
I had a really great time last night. Thank you. Thank you so much.

189
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,915
We'll talk later,okay? Yeah.

190
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,359
Thank you.

191
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,158
That wasn't a real date.

192
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,630
What the hell do you do on a real date?

193
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,872
Shut up and put my table back. Okay.

194
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,959
All right,kids, I gotta get to work.

195
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,199
If I don't input those numbers,

196
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,359
it doesn't make much of a difference.

197
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,195
So,like,you guys all have jobs?

198
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,834
Yeah,we all have jobs. See,that's how we buy stuff.

199
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:07,039
Yeah,I'm an actor. Would I have seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

200
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,472
Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

201
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,157
Look,Geppeto. I'm a real live boy.

202
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,600
I will not take this abuse. You're right. I'm sorry.

203
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,592
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy

204
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,159
So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,633
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

206
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,036
I know. He's just so...

207
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,559
Remember you and Tony De Marco? Yeah. It's like that. With feelings.

208
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
Are you in trouble!

209
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,553
Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work,

210
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,396
and not think about him all day.

211
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,793
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

212
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,079
Wish me luck! What for?

213
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,234
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

214
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,559
Hey,Monica. Hey,Franny. Welcome back. How was Florida? You had sex,didn't you?

215
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,838
How do you do that?

216
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,958
So,who? You know Paul?

217
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,676
Paul,the wine guy? Yeah,I know Paul.

218
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,076
You mean,you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

219
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,035
Before me,there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

220
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:57,875
Of course it was a line.Why?Why would anybody do something like that?We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:To get you into bed.

221
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:08,680
Is it me?Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs,and men with severe emotional problems can hear?All right,come here.Give me your feet.

222
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,954
I just thought he was nice,you know?

223
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,874
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

224
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,077
Guess what.You got a job?Are you kidding?I'm trained for nothing.

225
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:44,759
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.You would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale 50 percent off.How well you know me.

226
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:59,199
They're my new I don't need a job or my parents.I've got great boots boots.How'd you pay for them?Credit card.And who pays for that?My father.

227
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,400
You can't live off your parents your whole life.I know that.That's why I was getting married.

228
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,872
Give her a break.It's hard being on your own for the first time.

229
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,232
Thank you.You're welcome.I remember when I first came to this city,I was 14.

230
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,271
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.And I got here,and I didn't know anybody.

231
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:32,119
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields outside Port Authority.And then he killed himself.And then I found aromatherapy.So believe me,I know exactly how you feel.

232
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,119
The word you're looking for is:Anyway...

233
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,679
All right.You ready?I don't think so.Come on.Cut.Cut.

234
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:59,799
Hey.All right.Welcome to the real world.It sucks.You're gonna love it.

235
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:18,400
That's it.You gonna crash on the couch?No.No,I gotta go home sometime.Are you gonna be okay?Yeah.Look what I just found on the floor.

236
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:32,038
What?That's Paul's watch.You can just put it back where you found it.Oh,boy.All right.Good night,everybody.Good night.

237
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,318
Sorry.No.Go.No,have it,really.Split it?Okay.Okay.

238
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:56,712
Thanks.You probably didn't know this,but back in high school I had a major crush on you.

239
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,078
I knew.You did?

240
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,598
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.I did.

241
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,960
Listen,do you think...And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.

242
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:31,039
Do you think it would be okay if I ask you out sometime,maybe?Yeah.Maybe.Okay.

243
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,958
Okay,maybe I will.

244
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,797
Good night.Good night.

245
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
See you.

246
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,398
Wait.What's with you?

247
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,158
I just grabbed a spoon.

248
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:25,400
Can't believe what I'm hearing.I can't believe What I'm hearing here What?I said you had...What?I said you had...Would you stop?Was I doing it again?Yes.

249
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,755
Would anybody like more coffee?

250
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:40,839
Did you make it or are you just serving it?I'm just serving it.I'll have a cup of coffee.Kids,new dream.I'm in Las Vegas.I'm Liza Minnelli.

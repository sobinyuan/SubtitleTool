Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa  

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,160
from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Today, 
I have a special guest, my husband, Dan. 

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Dan:
Hello. 

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
Vanessa:
Today, we are going to be having a long  

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,560
English conversation, because over two years ago, 
back in February 2020, we made this conversation  

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,520
and millions of you loved this and said that 
it helped you to immerse yourself in English  

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,840
and have a fun time. Today, we are going to be 
doing something similar. We'll be talking about  

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,960
at least 10, possibly more, topics. We'll be 
giving our opinions and stories and ideas. 

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,536
Dan:
Answers. 

10
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,200
Vanessa:
Yes, whatever comes up  

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,600
along the way. There will be subtitles for key 
phrases down here, but you can also click CC to  

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,520
get the full subtitles so that you don't miss any 
words. All right, are you ready to get started? 

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Dan:
I'm ready. 

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Vanessa:
Let's do it.  

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,040
But wait, before we get started, like always, I 
have created a free PDF worksheet for this lesson  

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
that you can download. Never forget what you are 
about to learn. You can click on the link in the  

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,680

today, and you will have a chance to answer all  

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,232
of today's questions too.

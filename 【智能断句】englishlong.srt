00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,959
Vanessa:Hi,I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Today,I have a special guest,my husband,Dan. Dan:Hello.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,053
Vanessa:Today,we are going to be having a long English conversation,

3
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:18,499
because over two years ago,back in February 2020,

4
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:22,282
we made this conversation and millions of you loved this

5
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:26,444
and said that it helped you to immerse yourself in English and have a fun time.

6
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,754
Today,we are going to be doing something similar.

7
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:34,060
We'll be talking about at least 10,possibly more,topics.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,536
We'll be giving our opinions and stories and ideas. Dan:Answers.

9
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,492
Vanessa:Yes,whatever comes up along the way.

10
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:47,014
There will be subtitles for key phrases down here,

11
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,964
but you can also click CC to get the full subtitles

12
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:53,009
so that you don't miss any words.

13
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,838
All right,are you ready to get started? Dan:I'm ready. Vanessa:Let's do it.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,332
But wait,before we get started,like always,

15
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:10,158
I have created a free PDF worksheet for this lesson that you can download.

16
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:12,394
Never forget what you are about to learn.

17
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:14,752
You can click on the link in the description

18
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,216
to download this free PDF worksheet today,

19
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:22,129
and you will have a chance to answer all of today's questions too. Dan:Oo. Vanessa:Okay.

20
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,608
Are you ready for question number one? Dan:Yes,I'm ready.What is it? Vanessa:All right.Question number one

21
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:27,936
Dan:What is the meaning of life?

22
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:32,218
Vanessa:Oh,that would be a good start. Topic number one is family.

23
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:36,125
I'm going to be putting the timestamps for all of these topics

24
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,531
in the description,so if you want to rewatch any of these sections

25
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,432
you can easily skip to them.

26
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:43,952
My first question is about family,

27
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:50,043
and that is what is an interesting fact about your family history? Dan:Interesting fact.

28
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:54,512
Well,I don't know too much about my mom's side of the family.

29
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:58,355
I know they've been in the United States for a long time,

30
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,954
but they just didn't really keep any records.

31
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,640
On my dad's side,on the other hand,

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,400
I have a,well,I had a particularly detail oriented grandmother

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,068
who would remember everything about her childhood.

34
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,868
She went back and looked at,

35
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:23,959
I don't even know how she found documents about where they came from. Her family was in Germany,near,

36
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,291
I can't remember,I think it's Hamburg,Hamburg.

37
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,881
Grandpa was also from somewhere in Germany,

38
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:36,230
and both of them just happened to move to eastern Kansas,

39
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,563
which is if you've ever been to Kansas,

40
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:41,976
it's just corn fields and that's it.

41
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:44,219
It's not a very beautiful place,

42
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,712
but somehow they ended up in Kansas.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,312
Dan:My grandma would always give lots of details

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,750
about growing up there on the farm

45
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,937
and how they didn't have electricity.

46
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:59,520
She would go on about these stories about,

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,760
this is how she would talk,

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
one time,me and my brother Bern,

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,320
we went to the backyard and filled up the tin bucket with hot boiling water,

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,150
and he took all the hot water,Daniel.

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,568
Vanessa:She remembered it was a tin bucket. Dan:Yeah,and it was cousin Bern,

52
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,352
and it was Uncle Freddie,people like that.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,860
I think her father's name was Freddie. Vanessa:Oh,that's her son's name. Dan:Yeah.

54
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,160
I don't know how interesting that is,

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,325
but it's the only cultural knowledge I have about my past.

56
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:38,298
The other side of the family,they just,

57
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,800
we lived in Virginia a long time ago,

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,533
and my great grandfather was a coal miner apparently so kind of interesting,I guess. Vanessa:Yeah.

59
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,463
I think that's pretty cool though that

60
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,040
because in the US everyone has heritage from other places

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,960
around the world and it gets lost sometimes.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,458
In fact,that's what I was going to talk about too in a moment.

63
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,283
That area in Kansas,I remember your grandma saying

64
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:06,184
that there were German only churches. Dan:Oh yeah.

65
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,709
Vanessa:So they would speak only German.

66
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,316
Did your grandma know any German? Dan:Very little.

67
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,477
I don't think she knew a lot.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,149
Vanessa:I think that's kind of the generational thing, like her parents knew it.

69
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:18,285
Dan:She's probably the last generation that spoke German,

70
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:21,141
or her parents were the last generation that spoke German.

71
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:28,417
Vanessa:Yeah,but then for her she just understood probably some German. That community was,for some reason,

72
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,665
where lots of German people moved to

73
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:33,176
and that's where your family's from. Dan:Yeah.

74
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,980
They went through a lot of really challenging cultural changes.

75
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,153
There was a lot of German mistrust and hate during that time,

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,706
obviously,for reasons that we can understand. Vanessa:Political reasons.

77
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:47,850
Dan:We were at war with Germany a lot,

78
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,270
so I think they were trying to scrub out a lot of the super German sounding things.

79
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,871
Apparently our last name was more German sounding at one point.

80
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,112
I don't know how they said it,

81
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:02,155
and speaking German would certainly be one of those things.

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,136
Vanessa:Yeah,so they tried to assimilate to life and that's similar to my

83
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:08,404
Dan:Tell me about your family history.

84
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:11,582
Vanessa:similar to the interesting point I wanted to tell you about.

85
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:15,704
My family history is that on my dad's side,

86
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:18,975
my great grandma and my great grandpa,

87
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,633
they are from around the area of Naples,Italy.

88
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,509
First,my great grandpa went on a boat,

89
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,705
came to the US,married someone,had three kids. Dan:It was a good story. Vanessa:Then his wife died. Dan:Oh,that's the bad part.

90
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,848
Vanessa:He had three kids and no wife

91
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:39,138
and he's working,I'm sure,a really difficult job.

92
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,200
That was not a time when you could be a single father. Dan:This was in Pittsburgh,right?

93
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,349
Vanessa:They were either in New York or Pittsburgh,

94
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,502
but by the time my great grandma came, they went to Pittsburgh.

95
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:51,472
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

96
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:56,483
He wrote a letter to his mother who lived back in Italy, and he said,

97
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,468
I need to find a new wife.

98
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,700
Can you help me to find a new wife

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,577
from our hometown that will come here

100
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,827
to live with me and help take care of my three kids.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,313
His mom said, no problem. I'll find you a wife. I got her. Here's her height. Here's her dimensions.

102
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,512
Get a wedding dress for her.

103
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:23,324
My great grandpa got a wedding dress made in the US, the right size and everything for his future mysterious wife.

104
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:25,817
We call this a mail order bride.

105
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:31,439
He basically ordered her in a letter like you would a package. Vanessa:

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,071
I don't know what he did with his kids, but he went to Italy, and as legend has it,

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,000
one day he was in the house.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,915
They were preparing things for the wedding,

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,040
and he looked out the window and a woman walked by, and he said,

110
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,159
oh,that's the woman I want to marry. Dan: Who is that? Vanessa:

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,630
Was that his mail order bride? Nope, that was my great grandmother.

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,422
Dan: Was it her sister? The original woman's sister? Vanessa:

113
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:07,666
One of the legends is that it was his, well not his sister Dan: Adds to the drama. Vanessa: But my grandma clarified. This was her mother. She said,

114
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,800
oh,he saw her outside the window. Dan: Just a random lady?

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Vanessa: Uh huh. Well, this is all a little vague

116
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,944
because this is going back quite some time. Dan: Excuse me,ma'am? Will you marry me?? Vanessa: Basically.

117
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:32,715
She was taller than his other supposed to be wife. He married her. Her name was Antoinette. He married her. She said,

118
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:36,315
yes,I'm going to move to the US with you, leave my family.

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,140
She must have had a really tough situation, I imagine. They were all farmers.

120
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,374
I'm sure that was a really hard life,

121
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:46,863
and that could give her some hope for the future. In the wedding pictures,

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,224
her dress is a little bit too short

123
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,912
because it was not supposed to be her dress.

124
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:57,072
It was supposed to be the other lady's dress. I'm glad that happened

125
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:05,498
because otherwise I would not be here. Dan: That's Vanessa's origin story, really. Vanessa: Yeah. This lady,Antoinette, she moved to the US.

126
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:08,633
She had three kids and then her husband died,

127
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,726
so she had six children in a new country. Crazy story. She raised them.

128
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,548
She's what we might call the matriarch

129
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:20,719
of my dad's side of the family. Dan: Antoinette Manolfi. Vanessa:

130
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:30,490
Everybody who is from that side of the family knows her and reveres her. Oh,she was so amazing. Oh yeah, she just helped us survive.

131
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,951
We might say she was a survivor.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
She really went through a lot,

133
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,082
and she was the right person for the job because she made it work. Dan: Nice. Vanessa: Yeah.

134
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,921
That's an interesting story about my family.

135
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,478
I'm sure everyone has those as well.

136
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,340
I want to ask you the same question.

137
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,830
Let us know in the comments,

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,986
what's an interesting story or an interesting fact about your family history. We'd love to know.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,374
Let's go to question number two. This is about childhood.

140
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:59,554
I'd like to know what's something that you did

141
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,724
as a child that you still do now.

142
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:12,700
These are kind of personal questions to start off with. Dan: Well, we laughed before this because she said everything. I am a little bit, let's just say,

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,611
youthful in my approach to life.

144
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:21,829
That's the positive way to say it anyway. Something that I directly do, especially now,

145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,413
because I have kids, is catching critters. Vanessa: Oh yeah. Dan: Catching critters and keeping them.

146
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,353
I would say critters are generally small animals.

147
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,592
When I was a kid, I spent,

148
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:44,944
I would say 50 of my life trying to catch frogs, lizards, grasshoppers, snakes, bugs of any kind,

149
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:47,680
and I would keep them in cages.

150
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,720
I would use nets to catch butterflies, terrariums, aquariums, fish, anything like that.

151
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,889
I caught and kept lots and lots of critters.

152
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,502
There was probably a five year phase

153
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:05,799
where we didn't do that very much. Funnily enough,

154
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,926
even when we first got married, and you're into this too,

155
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,795
I don't know where she got this. Maybe it's infectious. Vanessa:

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
We caught tad poles as kids. Dan:

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,975
We would catch tad poles as just a married couple.

158
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,211
We'd go down to the pond

159
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,401
and scoop in and get some mucky,

160
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:29,572
gucky tad poles and watch them change into frogs. It's the miracle of life. Vanessa: You know what?

161
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:35,620
I have a distinct memory on our honeymoon, we were taking a hike, and you saw,

162
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,320
I think this was the first time

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,425
I'd ever caught critters with you because, I don't know, maybe when we were dating Dan:

164
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,670
She didn't know what she was signing up for. Vanessa: Maybe when we were dating,

165
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,840
we just weren't in those situations.

166
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
I remember we were on a hike

167
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,393
and you were in a stream picking up rocks, and you were so excited.

168
00:10:53,393 --> 00:11:01,240
This is a good salamander spot. There might be salamanders. Then you found one and I was so impressed. Dan: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Vanessa:

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,242
How did you find that salamander

170
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:07,748
because I caught tad poles maybe like every summer as a kid,

171
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,335
but I never caught salamanders or whole frogs or fish.

172
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,875
We had nets and caught fireflies and stuff,

173
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,272
but I think you take it to the next level. Dan: Yeah. Especially as a kid,

174
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,024
I took it to the next level.

175
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:25,136
One time I caught a five foot snake.

176
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:26,864
I didn't even know what kind it was,

177
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,400
I just reached into the bushes.

178
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,217
I didn't grab it the right way.

179
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,369
I was like swinging it through the air.

180
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:42,409
That was probably the dumbest thing I ever did honestly catching critters as a child. It extends beyond that too. I've always liked keeping fish.

181
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:45,078
I love making fish tanks and the environments.

182
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,851
Obviously you can do that for frogs and reptiles.

183
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:51,380
I have big dreams for my son

184
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,480
because he's also very into this. Vanessa:Oh yeah.

185
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,078
He is crazed about his net and catching stuff. He just loves that.

186
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,312
I mean it's treasures in nature.

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,072
Dan:Soon enough,our house will turn into a menagerie of critters. Vanessa:I just have one rule. I would Dan:Scorpions.

188
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:13,720
Vanessa:I don't mind keeping frogs and lizards and fish. Dan:Snakes?

189
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,704
Vanessa:But I don't want to keep any snakes. Dan:Oh,come on.

190
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,000
Vanessa:I know a lot of snakes are harmless Dan:They're cute.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,197
Vanessa:but I would rather the snakes live under our shed than live in our house. Dan:That's more dangerous. Vanessa:Well,if they're not poisonous.

192
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,528
If they're not venomous,then they can catch rats

193
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:38,454
and catch things and keep our chicken safe,that type of thing. Dan:That's what snakes do? Vanessa:Yeah. A lot of chickens Dan:They protect chickens. Vanessa:Yeah.

194
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,438
A lot of people,and this is getting a little deep Dan:Are chickens critters?

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,322
Vanessa:I don't this so. When I think of a critter,

196
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:55,794
I think of crawling,like something that goes like k k k k, like a little crawly thing. Dan:Am I a critter? Vanessa:That's a good question.

197
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:57,893
I was going to say some people,

198
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:02,481
we have chickens,you might have seen this on our YouTube channel before,

199
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,714
some people purposefully have a rat snake or a black snake,

200
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,075
a garter snake that lives in their chicken coop,

201
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:20,416
and they eat like one egg per two weeks or something. They don't eat that much. Dan:Is that good? Vanessa:They do it for protection. They're keeping rats away.

202
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,306
They're keeping other things away from the coop.

203
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:25,223
There's a whole,let me tell you

204
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:30,234
Dan:You want me to bring snakes into our family, well,but outside?

205
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,354
Vanessa:As long as they are outside,that's okay.

206
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,337
I don't want snakes in my house.

207
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:39,284
Dan:I have lots of good stories about snakes in the house.

208
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:42,797
One snake escaped in the house. Vanessa:Oh,don't tell me that.

209
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,656
Dan:My mom found it under the couch months later and it was dead. Vanessa:Oh no.Yeah.

210
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:56,627
Dan:It was one of those classic situations of mom screams in the other room, and we're like what?What?

211
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,117
Vanessa:You kids have that snake in here?

212
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,528
Dan:Daniel,gee,what is this thing?That's what she'd say.

213
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:10,571
Vanessa:Well,do you want to share also while we're on this topic, your first memory,the frog? Dan:Oh my very first memory. Vanessa:Yes.

214
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:14,184
This will drill in the point that Dan loves critters. Dan:Yeah.

215
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:17,152
I caught a toad probably when I was two years old

216
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:20,380
and I was,for some reason,holding it off my deck

217
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,181
and I dropped it down into the bushes. I remember thinking,no,my toad.

218
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:28,417
Then I went down to look for it and I couldn't find it.

219
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,682
Vanessa:This is Dan's first memory in life.

220
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:35,531
Dan:Yeah,literally one,at least as far as I know. Vanessa:Well,there you go. Dan:Yeah. That's the point of it?

221
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:41,920
Vanessa:A lifetime of catching critters started at a young age. Well,I think Dan:Yeah. How about you? Vanessa:For me?

222
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,312
Dan:What do you still do besides catching lots of critters?

223
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,028
Vanessa:I do catch tad poles still. That's fun.

224
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,954
I think the thing that first came to my mind,

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,701
and I tried to think about just like the first thing

226
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,412
that came to my mind for each of these,

227
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,624
is when I was a kid I loved to dig in the dirt.

228
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:03,407
My sister and I had two best friends who lived right across the street,

229
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:08,184
and we spent hours in the backyard just digging in the dirt.

230
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:11,424
We built things in the dirt. We had little inventions.

231
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,989
We made homes in the dirt. We did so many things.

232
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,087
Now I dig in the dirt,but I call it gardening.

233
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,280
Dan:I think we have the wrong YouTube channel.

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,760
We just need to be covered in mud with like snakes and gardening.

235
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,573
Vanessa:Maybe that will be YouTube channel Dan:Number two. Vanessa:Number two,

236
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:31,038
Dan catches critters and Vanessa digs in the dirt and gardens.

237
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,754
I remember when I was in seventh grade at school,

238
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:44,608
we had a class,I think it was Home Ec., which is like home economics. You learn about cooking,and sewing, and those types of things.

239
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:50,536
There was a hygiene section where you learned how to take care of your hair,

240
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:54,113
how to take care of your nails. I remember specifically

241
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:58,308
Dan:How to take care of your nails? Vanessa:I know. Dan:There's a class about that? Vanessa:Well,it was like how to,

242
00:15:58,308 --> 00:16:00,540
I don't know,some people maybe don't learn that at home,

243
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,298
like how to trim your nails and stuff.

244
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:05,482
This lady was one of those people that as a middle schooler,

245
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,341
most middle schoolers just roll their eyes at,

246
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,304
like,oh,you think I'm going to do that?

247
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:12,990
Oh,I'm not going to be like you, but she was our teacher.

248
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:22,904
She was telling us how to clean our nails and paint them in this type of thing. I remember asking Dan:Was it for ladies only? Vanessa:Yeah,we were split by gender,

249
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,607
so there was boys in one class,

250
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,310
girls in the other just for Home

251
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,045
Ec. I remember her saying how to clean your nails and make them look nice.

252
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,464
I remember asking in the class,

253
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:39,672
I said,but what if I always have dirt under my nails?

254
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,740
Dan:You raised your hands and asked that? Vanessa:I asked that question. I was so naive.

255
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,440
I always have dirt under my nails.

256
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,897
I can't get them clean like that. She looked at me like,what?

257
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,188
Like I had three heads on my head.

258
00:16:55,188 --> 00:17:01,503
What?Why would you have dirt under your nails? You're a seventh grade girl. I think after that Dan:Be proper.

259
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:04,447
Vanessa:maybe when I was in eighth grade or so

260
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,672
I had a phase where I stopped playing in the dirt

261
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,990
and did other things. Now I have come full circle and well, I took a shower recently,

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,668
so my nails are actually clean,

263
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,633
but they're almost always full of dirt. Just like our kids.

264
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,224
Dan:I'm sure you put in more effort

265
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:25,570
to get the dirt out now. Vanessa:Yeah.Kind of. Sometimes it works,sometimes it doesn't,

266
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,381
but I have the same mindset as a seventh grader of,well,

267
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,200
my hands aren't going to be completely clean because Dan:You really do.

268
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,672
Vanessa:I was just playing in the dirt. What's the matter with that?

269
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,430
Dan:If you look at Vanessa's wardrobe,

270
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,040
I have more clothes than her half the time.

271
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,246
Vanessa:I don't really care about those kind of things.

272
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:46,320
Dan:Yeah.She's not you're a typical girly girl. Let's put it that way. A girly girl. Vanessa:That's okay. Dan:That's my sister.

273
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,767
Maybe we'll talk about her later. Vanessa:Okay.All right.

274
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,906
Well,let's go to our next question. But before we do that, I want to ask you,

275
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,979
what is something that you did in childhood that you still do now?

276
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,724
Let us know in the comments.

277
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:02,337
All right.Let's go to question number three.

278
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,548
Question number three is about hobbies.

279
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,866
I'd like to know if you could wake up tomorrow

280
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,310
and magically have any kind of education,

281
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:19,680
talent,or skill set,what would it be? Dan:Education or skill? Vanessa:Yeah,this is very broad. Dan:Yes.Well,when I think skill,

282
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,800
I mean,I think that I would want to be,

283
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:30,680
and this is a little stereotypical, an athlete of some kind, particularly a hockey player.

284
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,139
When you are playing a sport

285
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,323
and you really like that sport,

286
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,872
you get into the flow and you just live in that moment

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,651
and you just have so much fun.

288
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,422
I can remember as a kid,

289
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,092
one time I scored a goal to win the game in hockey,

290
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:51,752
and that's just the greatest feeling ever. Now,if you add to that, a big

291
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,259
stadium full of fans cheering your name Am I egotistical?I don't know.

292
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,866
That would just be the ultimate thrill

293
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:05,735
to score a goal and hear everybody cheering. I would say,yeah,

294
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:09,639
either an athlete of some kind or a performer.

295
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,031
I think you get the same kind of feeling if you are acting,

296
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:21,993
if you're maybe a standup comedian and you're making people laugh. Dan:Even to a certain degree,

297
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:24,314
I think being a really great teacher,

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,295
being a really great teacher

299
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,100
probably gives you that same kind of feeling

300
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,996
of you're performing and bringing value and people are entertained.

301
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,537
If I were to have like,

302
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:44,121
I wasn't thinking so much education, I was thinking more skills,

303
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,753
so I would wake up tomorrow

304
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:48,520
and I'd be the best hockey player on earth. Vanessa:Wow.

305
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,519
Dan:Maybe that'd be a little bit boring

306
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,158
just beating everybody right and left.

307
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:00,105
I'm sure you still have to work though. Yeah,I'd have great athletic prowess. Vanessa:Cool. Dan:How about you?

308
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:02,112
What would you want to wake up tomorrow with?

309
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:05,570
Vanessa:Well,I said something a little bit stereotypical too.

310
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,352
I had my primary answer and then

311
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,514
a maybe cheat answer. I think if I could wake up tomorrow with a skill,

312
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,474
maybe I said something a little more realistic.

313
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:29,083
I said,I'd like to be able to play the ukulele really well. Dan:The ukulele? Vanessa:I don't play the ukulele. I play the flute. I don't know.

314
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,820
I just thought if I could have a cool skill,

315
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,520
I mean,that's something that I could take outside.

316
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,740
I could be playing while the kids are playing.

317
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,360
Dan:This is a very humble dream. Vanessa:Maybe it is.

318
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
I didn't want to think for too long about this.

319
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,784
I wanted to give you my initial response.

320
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,028
Yeah,I think it would be cool.

321
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:50,280
A guitar is pretty big to take somewhere. A piano would be amazing,

322
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,305
but it's not quite as portable.

323
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,575
I just feel like sometimes when you're, I had this image,

324
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:58,620
like you're sitting around a bonfire and the sun setting

325
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,918
and you're just chatting with your friends,

326
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:08,096
just having a ukulele and playing some music, oh,that just brings the atmosphere to a very warm place.

327
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:10,710
Dan:You could play Wheels On the Bus for our children.

328
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,555
Vanessa:I could maybe play Wheels On the Bus in five minutes.

329
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:22,572
Dan:That's the first song that comes to my head. The version we listen to, It's like do,do,do,do, and I just hear ukulele. Vanessa:Yeah. Well,if you play the ukulele

330
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,196
and you have any recommendations,

331
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,038
let me know in the comments, but my cheat answer,

332
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,676
because I wasn't sure if it was a skillset or a character trait, but I said unlimited patience.

333
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,239
If I could wake up in the morning Dan:That's an education.

334
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:40,471
Vanessa:and oh,I guess you can learn patience.

335
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:46,053
If I could have unlimited patience with my children, that would be amazing, and with myself.

336
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,760
Dan:They'd get away with you too much though. Vanessa:I don't know.

337
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,640
I think you can be firm and also be patient.

338
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,040
It doesn't mean you have no standards,

339
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,023
but I think that I would,yeah,

340
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,806
just be able to be a little bit,

341
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:08,960
I think you're always a better parent when you are more patient. Dan:They certainly test the patience. Vanessa:Yes. Unlimited patience would be awesome. What about you?

342
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,460
If you could wake up tomorrow and have any education, talent,or skill set, what would it be?

343
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,468
Would it be speaking English fluently,

344
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,101
or maybe it would be something else.

345
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,422
Let us know in the comments.

346
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:24,072
Let's go to question number four.

347
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,700
Question number four is about travel.

348
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,582
I'd like to know where is the next place

349
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,284
in the US that you'd like to visit?

350
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,057
Dan:Oh,I've got to travel in the US? Vanessa:Yeah.

351
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:36,596
I wanted it to be a little more specific

352
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:39,200
and it might be interesting to some of our international students

353
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
to learn about places in the US.

354
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,121
Dan:I'm joking because there are a lot

355
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,245
of amazing places in the US,

356
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:50,294
but I really love international cities like Europe and Asia.

357
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:53,420
I just think they're so interesting. Vanessa:I know.

358
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,647
Dan:But the US has lots of beautiful natural environments,

359
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:07,401
so I would probably travel to Washington or Oregon. Vanessa:You know what? Dan:You'd say the same thing.

360
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:13,190
Vanessa:My first answer was the northwest, Seattle,that area,Oregon, and I crossed it off.

361
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,680
Dan:Did you think that I was going to say that? Vanessa:No,

362
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,930
I thought of somewhere I would rather visit first. Dan:Oh,I'm with you. Okay.

363
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,473
Vanessa:I'd like to go there too. Dan:Yeah.

364
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,783
The Pacific northwest because I've never been there

365
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:27,120
and it just looks so stunningly beautiful there,

366
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,502
at least for part of the year. It has really big mountains and really dense green forests,

367
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:36,301
and it has the ocean as well.

368
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:43,106
I really love a landscape that has lots of rocky features, but also the ocean.

369
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:49,434
That's one of my favorite kinds of landscapes. I would probably go there,

370
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,296
and it has really cool cities too.

371
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,390
Seattle is a really awesome city and you could jump up,

372
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,912
I mean I've never been there, but it looks really cool,

373
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:58,639
and you can jump up to Vancouver as well

374
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,291
and get that full Pacific northwest experience. That's where I would choose.

375
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,697
I could do lots of outdoorsy stuff.

376
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,131
I could see a different side of the country

377
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,882
and even do some urban things as well. Vanessa:Yeah.

378
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,244
That sounds like a fun place.

379
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:28,200
In fact,one of my options too. Dan:Yeah. What did you choose instead? Vanessa:Well,I thought about that. Dan:Wait,let me guess. Grand Canyon. Vanessa:Close. Dan:New Mexico. Vanessa:A little more general. Dan:Arizona.

380
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Vanessa:I said I want to rent an RV

381
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,960
and have a big tour of the west, southwest,national parks.

382
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,536
Dan:Oh this is a regional thing. Vanessa:Yeah,

383
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:46,792
because there's so many amazing national parks in the west,southwest, not even southwest,

384
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,311
but just the west of the US.

385
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,970
I think that would be an awesome

386
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,887
two month journey where you say

387
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,571
I'm going to book a bunch of camping places

388
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,389
and you're not having to like tent camp.

389
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:02,230
I think that might be a little too intense for us for two months, but in an RV with

390
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,313
Vanessa:Were intense for us for two months. But,in an RV,

391
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:05,824
it would still be in cool locations,

392
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,154
maybe closer to the national parks,

393
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:16,240
and you get to see a lot. Because,two months ago, we went to Colorado, in Colorado Springs

394
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,342
and I'd never seen the Rocky Mountains

395
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:28,170
or that area of the U.S. And I was blown away. It is so beautiful. Yeah,I've been reading some books

396
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,650
about that area of the U.S.,

397
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,260
and historical fiction about the history there. And yeah,I'm fascinated.

398
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,913
I think that would be really cool

399
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:41,120
to check out some of the history, check out some beautiful places. We like hiking,

400
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,092
so it seems like a good fit. Dan:Yeah.

401
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:46,400
And it's very different from where we live now. Vanessa:Yeah. Surprisingly,so. Dan:Yeah.

402
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,796
So,I chose the wettest part of the country and you chose the driest. Vanessa:Yeah. Yeah. I think

403
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,631
that was really shocking to me, when we went to Colorado. It's super dry there.

404
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:08,218
And I've been in dry climates before Dan:And,Arizona is way drier. Vanessa:Oh,I bet. Yeah,there's deserts there. Dan:Mm hmm. Vanessa:But I feel like, being somewhere like that,

405
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:14,960
even though the U.S.is the same country, it feels so different,

406
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,333
that it does feel like you've gone almost into a different world

407
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,892
when you visit different climates like that and different geography.

408
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:27,501
Dan:It is very easily could be many countries. Vanessa:Oh,it could very easily be. Dan:Maybe it should be. Vanessa:Many countries.

409
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,006
So,I want to know for you,

410
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,511
if you live in the U.S.

411
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:33,770
or if you got the chance to visit the U.S.,

412
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,516
where would you like to visit?

413
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:38,232
Where's the first place that you would like to go

414
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,725
if you got to come to the U.S.?

415
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,046
Let us know in the comments.

416
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:42,865
And,let's go to question number four.

417
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:50,914
I actually meant question number five. Dan:Whoops. Vanessa:So question number five, the topic is food. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Something that we love.

418
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:55,518
I would like to know what is a food from your travels, our travels,

419
00:26:55,518 --> 00:27:00,800
that you wish you could have again? Dan:Man,this is the hardest question,

420
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,872
because we've had so many delicious meals in our travels.

421
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:09,910
And we just love different food as well. Vanessa:Yeah.

422
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,189
Dan:And this is very tied up in nostalgia for me too,

423
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,196
because we lived in South Korea for three years.

424
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:23,856
And,the meals were so different from America, and distinct, and we actually enjoyed them.

425
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:26,736
So,now I can't get them the same way.

426
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:30,208
So,if you go to a Korean restaurant in America,

427
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:33,764
you're going to spend a lot more to get something

428
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:39,659
that isn't as probably as quality as what you'd get there. Vanessa:It's a different atmosphere, all of that.

429
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,285
Dan:So I had a tough decision to make.

430
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:47,840
So,I chose a meal called foreign language 00:27:46 Vanessa:Okay.

431
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,000
Dan:Which means three layered flesh in Korean. Vanessa:Thick bacon,basically. Dan:It's bacon. It's thick bacon.

432
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,803
But,you would cook this on a grill in front of you

433
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,606
in a restaurant with lots of people

434
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:02,448
and you'd hit a little bell and it goes dingdong.

435
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,152
And then waitress says,foreign language 00:28:05

436
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:07,096
And she fills up your water.

437
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:10,320
It's more a whole experience than just the food.

438
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,245
But if Vanessa:If you finish your side dishes,

439
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:17,228
they'll bring you endless amounts of other side dishes. Dan:Yes. Endless side dishes.

440
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,730
So,it's not really just one thing,

441
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,233
it's more of the whole experience.

442
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,748
And it has a lot of nostalgia for us,

443
00:28:24,748 --> 00:28:27,940
because you can't really get the same thing here.

444
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:38,400
You can,but it's just not quite the same. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:And it was always delicious, especially in South Korea. Even us,relatively thin people,

445
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,439
we lost weight when we went to South Korea,

446
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:45,990
because it's just way less rich food in general, compared to American diets.

447
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,240
And,we didn't have very much money,

448
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,985
so we didn't eat this all the time. We just ate it sometimes. So,that was always a winner.

449
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,746
And,I have to add another one,

450
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,997
because we have traveled in Europe as well. And,technically this meal is tastier,

451
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:10,052
I'm thinking of... Can you guess? Vanessa:Cinque Terre. Dan:Yep. Vanessa:Cinque Terre. Dan:Yes.

452
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:15,237
There was a seafood meal we ate in Cinque Terre that had...

453
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:24,746
I don't even remember what we ate, fish,pasta. Vanessa:I had a octopus. Dan:Amazing wine. Vanessa:And pasta meat thing. Yeah. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Crazy.

454
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:29,860
Dan:And,that was also a good vibe. Nostalgic experience.

455
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,010
Because,when I think back to it,

456
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,220
we did a lot of beautiful hikes on that trip.

457
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,860
And then,we ended in the last little town

458
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,048
and ate at that restaurant and it was really delicious. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:So,it all worked out perfectly.

459
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,383
Vanessa:Even if we go back there,

460
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:47,110
it will be a different vibe and different feel, because like you said,

461
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,036
I think,food is really tied to nostalgia.

462
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:57,128
So,the atmosphere and you can't just eat the food separately from anything else. Dan:Bing bong. Vanessa:Yeah.

463
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,393
We don't have bells on the table to call the waitress.

464
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,834
Dan:If you're Korean and watching this,

465
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,720
you're like,What's the big deal about that? Vanessa:But for us Dan:But for us,it's just so, This is so funny and Vanessa:It was so great. And yeah,we love that experience. Dan:Yes.

466
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:24,147
Vanessa:Mine is Dan:So how about you? Yes. Vanessa:Very similar. In fact,yeah Dan:Was it the same meal? Vanessa:No, I thought about saying, not specifically some inaudible 00:30:22 but just eating outside.

467
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:26,246
It's basically on a sidewalk,

468
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:31,372
there's little plastic tables and you're cooking this type of thing that Dan's talking about.

469
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,727
But,the one that I thought about was also in Korea

470
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:39,913
because there's a lot of nostalgia. Dan:Is it inaudible 00:30:37 Vanessa:I almost said inaudible 00:30:39 Dan:I thought that too. Vanessa:I almost said inaudible 00:30:40

471
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:44,445
Dan:It's not always the best food, but the environment was perfect. Vanessa:Yeah. But what I said also

472
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:46,000
because I like the food so much

473
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,312
is a meal called dak galbi. Dan:Oh. Vanessa:And,there was a restaurant

474
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:53,656
specifically the restaurant that we went to often in Incheon,

475
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:59,800
which was the city we lived in for the first two years in Korea. And,our first week living there,

476
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,737
it was my birthday in September.

477
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:06,185
And,we went there with a bunch of new friends.

478
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:08,960
And,I had never eaten something like this before,

479
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
where we sat at a table,

480
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
and they had a burner on the table,

481
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,036
and they had all the ingredients there, and it was uncooked chicken,

482
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,600
cabbage,rice cakes, all of these things,carrots, the sauce.

483
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,210
It was all in this thing.

484
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,929
And,the person who was the server was helping to Dan:She tossed it up. Vanessa:Helping to cook it.

485
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,332
And we were all just sitting there and watching it.

486
00:31:29,332 --> 00:31:33,420
It's very different from an American hibachi experience.

487
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,483
That's a similar experience or similar idea

488
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:43,360
where someone is cooking in front of you, but this was different, much more casual. Dan:Yeah.

489
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,784
Vanessa:And I remember sitting there for my birthday,

490
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,994
surrounded by all these new friends, in a new city,

491
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:51,260
eating this food that I thought was so exciting,

492
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,860
and they're cooking it in front of us. And it is amazingly delicious. Dan:Mm hmm. It was very yummy. Vanessa:And,that place is, yeah,full of so many memories.

493
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,632
So,whenever someone came to visit us from the U.S.,

494
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:02,809
or we made a new friend,

495
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,660
we would always go to that restaurant.

496
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,093
And then,the third year we lived in South Korea,

497
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,663
we moved to a city called Suan,

498
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,076
which is about an hour away.

499
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,258
And,after that year,that restaurant closed. No. Dan:No.

500
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:21,915
Vanessa:So,when this question says,something you wish you could try again,

501
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,936
this will always be just a wish.

502
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:27,345
Dan:I'm sure that lady opened up another restaurant,right? Vanessa:I hope so.

503
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,654
I hope she is world renowned as amazing dak galbi restaurant,

504
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:36,756
because we had dak galbi also in Suan, and that was nice. That lady was super nice.

505
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:39,527
We talked through Google translate a lot. Dan:Yeah.

506
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:41,039
Their dak galbi was good too.

507
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,139
Vanessa:Yeah,but there something about that first place that really Dan:It had the nostalgia.

508
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,748
Vanessa:It has a special place in my heart. So,that's what I would say.

509
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,110
Dan:It is funny though,we would take Korean people there

510
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:56,282
and they'd be like,Yeah,it's pretty good. Vanessa:But for us,that was Dan:We're like,This is so awesome. Vanessa:So fun. Yeah.

511
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:59,082
Anyway,you can see,we get very excited about food.

512
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:02,788
Now,maybe I know why our children are also excited about food.

513
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,896
They're crazed about food,so. Dan:It's because their kids. Vanessa:Yeah.

514
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:09,032
But some kids are very picky. Dan:Well,that's true.

515
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:10,616
Yeah,they do like more food than average kids.

516
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:15,420
Vanessa:Our kids love all this type of stuff just as passionately as us. All right.

517
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,388
So I have a question for you.

518
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:20,874
What is a food from your travels that you wish you could have again?

519
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,557
It might be because it was good.

520
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:25,320
It might be because of the vibe,and the atmosphere,

521
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,520
and the memories,the nostalgia,like what we talked about.

522
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,307
Let us know in the comments what food you wish you could have again,

523
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:33,649
and we'll learn about food from around the world.

524
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:40,236
All right,let's go to the next question, question number six. I think we're on six. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:All right,question number six.

525
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,650
Question number six is about nature.

526
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:51,554
This is maybe a little silly of a question,but that's okay. Dan:We like critters,so that's okay. Vanessa:Yeah,as you can tell.

527
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:57,594
So,this question is,if you could have any defense mechanism of an animal,

528
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:06,773
what would you have? So if you could have that type of defense mechanism in your body or become you Dan:In my body. Vanessa:Yes. What would it be?

529
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:10,352
So can we maybe explain quickly what a defense mechanism is? Dan:Yeah,sure.

530
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:14,933
So,a defense mechanism is something that an animal has or uses

531
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:18,320
a feature that protects it from predators. Vanessa:Yeah.

532
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,560
Dan:Or is a way to either get the predator to go away or escape the predator.

533
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,568
Vanessa:So maybe quills on a porcupine,something like this.

534
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:33,151
And we can even say humans have a defense mechanism. We might use that emotionally. Dan:Oh yeah.

535
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:37,355
Vanessa:To say,Oh,why is he always making jokes?

536
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:45,123
It's actually a defense mechanism because he experienced a lot of trauma in his life,

537
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:52,109
and joking,and laughing helps him to not feel so vulnerable. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:Or something like this.

538
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:53,409
It's a more of an emotional thing.

539
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,748
So you can have a defense mechanism as a human,

540
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,992
but I want to know,in a silly way,

541
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:03,144
if you could imagine having an animal's defense mechanism,what would it be?

542
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:08,165
Dan:Mine would be...This is a little bit of a cop out. Vanessa:Okay. Dan:Flying. Vanessa:Oh.

543
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:12,935
Dan:Because now we don't really associate flying with just defense,

544
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:16,633
but it can certainly be used as a defense,

545
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,698
so a bird will fly away when you come near it.

546
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:24,986
And we were talking about it earlier and saying that flying probably evolved

547
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:29,837
as a defense mechanism for an animal to get out of the way from a predator

548
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,352
really efficiently and effectively. Vanessa:Yeah,I almost said flying too for this one. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:It's a good one.

549
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:36,773
Dan:So,I mean,but who doesn't want to fly? Vanessa:Yeah.

550
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:39,440
Dan:I mean,of course then you have to be really lightweight

551
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,310
and you're probably not very intimidating.

552
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,636
And then,you have to be a bat or a bird. Vanessa:You could be an Eagle.

553
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,384
Dan:But,if I could still be me and fly,then I would choose that.

554
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,829
Vanessa:Yeah,just imagine,you're walking down a dark alley,

555
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,191
I don't know why you're walking down a dark alley,

556
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:55,295
and then somebody dangerous steps out

557
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,530
and all of a sudden your wings open up and you fly away.

558
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,504
Dan:Ooh,they pop out of my back like an angel. Vanessa:That's it. Yeah,that's it.

559
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:06,894
I think there's some X Men or superhero or something that does that. Dan:Oh,yeah,probably.

560
00:36:06,894 --> 00:36:13,440
We don't know about that stuff. Dan:Bird man. Vanessa:Bird man. Is that a Dan:Or Batman,squawk man. Vanessa:Eagle man.

561
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,312
Vanessa:Okay. Dan:Raven man. Robin man. Robin. Vanessa:California condo man. Dan:Blue bird man.

562
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:26,733
Vanessa:These are all the birds we know. Okay,well Dan:And we're not into superheroes,so. Vanessa:Flying is a good one. I almost said that. And you know what?

563
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:30,560
I think,I have something different I'd like to share.

564
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,320
But,I think for me actually flying is probably more realistic.

565
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,232
Not like I can actually fly,

566
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:39,952
but because if I'm faced with danger,

567
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:44,096
I'm probably more likely to flee. Dan:Oh,yeah. Vanessa:Than to fight.

568
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:45,680
So,we call this fight or flight.

569
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,928
When you're in a dangerous situation,

570
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:51,832
either dangerous physically or dangerous emotionally,

571
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,396
we say,Oh,your fight or flight kicks in.

572
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:05,760
So,either you fight and you try to win or you flee. So,that's Dan:Run away. Vanessa:The flight part. You're not actually flying,

573
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,224
but maybe you try to run away from that dangerous situation.

574
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,918
And I think for me,that's more true.

575
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:19,034
I'm more likely to run away from danger. Dan:Lady folk,in general. Vanessa:But I said something dinner... Dinner?Different. I said something different.

576
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,200
Dan:Food is still on her mind. Vanessa:Oh,food. I said something different.

577
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,034
I said,a horny toad,which is actually a type of lizard.

578
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:30,916
A horny toad has something very interesting that they do.

579
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:37,436
They,when faced with danger can stop their blood flow to their heart.

580
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:49,075
Their blood fills up in them and they shoot blood out of their eyes at their aggressor. What? Dan:Into their aggressor's eyes? Vanessa:At least at their aggressor.

581
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:52,825
And the blood isn't venomous or anything like this, it's just shocking.

582
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:55,920
So,I thought it would be hilarious. Dan:That would shock me.

583
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,058
Vanessa:If,Oh,hi,I'm Vanessa. Nice Vanessa. And then,somebody is a bad person and I just went bzz

584
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:06,855
and shot blood out my eyes at them. Dan:Yeah.

585
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:10,696
Vanessa:I think it would be so shocking that I could be saved. Dan:Sure.

586
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:16,074
Vanessa:But,maybe flying is something I would realistically be more likely to do.

587
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,413
Oh,I probably would fly away instead of fighting.

588
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,150
But,shooting blood out of your eyes if you're in danger?

589
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:32,325
Dan:It's not going to win you a lot of dates. Vanessa:No. Dan:Hey,baby. Vanessa:Look what I can do. Yeah,but isn't that crazy, that it's actually a lizard,

590
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:38,394
but the horn toad can shoot blood out of its eyes? How in the world

591
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,912
Dan:And how does that even help it?

592
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,158
Vanessa:Did even nature decide to do this? Dan:I don't know.

593
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,155
Vanessa:I mean,it must be in danger in some ways that it goes away,

594
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,612
it makes stuff go away because of that. Anyway,crazy,so.

595
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:49,356
Dan:The animal is just so disgusted,

596
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,756
it doesn't want to eat it. Vanessa:I know.

597
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:53,503
You got blood shooting out of your eyes. What?

598
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:54,980
So,I want to know for you,

599
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,116
if you could have any animal's defense mechanism, what would it be?

600
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:01,690
There are many crazy things out there.

601
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,989
There are ants that shoot acid,

602
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:06,602
there are porcupines that have quills.

603
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:13,048
This is a great way to expand your vocabulary in a fun way. If you would like,

604
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:17,180
you can type into Google amazing animal defense mechanisms.

605
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,570
And you'll see many lists of cool things that animals do if you like that stuff. So I want to know,

606
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,971
let me know in the comments,

607
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:26,071
what would you like to defend yourself with?

608
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,469
All right,let's go to our next question. Dan:Caw.

609
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:33,598
Vanessa:Question number seven is about holidays.

610
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,980
The question is,what is your favorite holiday tradition?

611
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,010
And I have a feeling that we might have the same one. Dan:We had to have.

612
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:52,188
Vanessa:So do you want to say it at the same time? Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:On three? Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Okay.3,2,1, Dan:Christmas tree. Vanessa:Decorating the Christmas tree. Dan:Yes. Decorating the Christmas tree. Vanessa:Yeah.

613
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:53,528
Okay.Why don't you explain first?

614
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:56,052
Why do you like decorating the Christmas tree? Dan:Man.

615
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,846
There's probably a lot of reasons.

616
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:04,092
One primary reason is that this is a tradition that our family always did. Vanessa:Mm hmm.

617
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:07,439
Dan:So it has a lot of nostalgia tied up into it.

618
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:15,074
And we don't have a lot of other traditions that our family always did. So there's Thanksgiving,which is,

619
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:19,562
you have a meal and you talk about what you're thankful for. And that's another big one.

620
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:23,481
But,maybe it's just because you put presents under a tree

621
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:29,686
that,as a kid,you just can't get enough of Christmas. Vanessa:And now? Dan:Yes.

622
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:35,345
And now,I really enjoy picking out a Christmas tree. We're really nature y.

623
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,360
So,we get a real Christmas tree

624
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,560
and I like the smell of the pine.

625
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,132
It just hits all of the right senses and feelings.

626
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:47,350
And then,you get to decorate it. So,your kids are excited,

627
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,968
and you get to hang up all the stuff, and put up the lights, and there's a whole process.

628
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,120
And,it's funny because it's probably the most useless thing

629
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,410
that we do,but it's one of the best things. Vanessa:Yeah.

630
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,260
I think,even before we had kids,

631
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,958
this was a big deal for us. Dan:Of course. Vanessa:In our marriage,

632
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,167
because yeah,it's something that you do with your parents growing up.

633
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,660
And then,for us,when we got married

634
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,728
and we started doing that with each other,

635
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:22,728
it felt like,Oh,this is our new life. This is us. We're doing this together. And you're Dan:We're starting the new generation. Vanessa:Yeah,our new traditions.

636
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:27,727
We're doing this in our own way. Yeah,it felt different. I said that for me,

637
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:29,653
because when I was a kid,

638
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:34,972
we didn't have a real Christmas tree, we had a fake tree. But even in that,

639
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:36,822
I was so excited about it.

640
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:40,433
First of all,I'll set the stage, my mom popped popcorn.

641
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:45,283
So,we ate popcorn and it smelled great. We listened to Christmas music. Dan:Always good.

642
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,588
Vanessa:And then,we all sat in the living room,

643
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:52,151
and because we had a fake tree, there's different fake trees, but the kind we had,

644
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:54,875
there was a stem in the middle and it had

645
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,922
different holes and you could hook the branches in

646
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:01,564
and the branches had different colored rings on them,

647
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:04,528
so you could see the big ones are on the bottom.

648
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:08,696
But,because these were closed in a box the entire year, they were flat.

649
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:11,273
So,we would all sit around the Christmas tree,

650
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,453
bending the branches to look realistic.

651
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:17,372
So,we would bend each of the little branches on it and then put it in.

652
00:42:17,372 --> 00:42:21,712
And we'd look at each other's and say, Oh,that one doesn't look good. Or,Oh, that was really great.

653
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:23,264
Dan:This is all blasphemy to me.

654
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:26,020
Vanessa:Because you always had a real tree. Dan:It had to be real. Vanessa:And then we

655
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,565
Dan:If there's not a fire hazard in your living room, it's not Christmas.

656
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:32,772
Vanessa:Yeah,that's a big reason why we had a fake tree

657
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:37,605
is because when my dad was a kid, they had a real tree. Dan:Oh,yeah. Vanessa:Maybe for one Christmas,

658
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:40,493
I don't remember if it was for longer than that.

659
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:44,088
And they had a train set going around it

660
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:46,346
so they could turn on the electric train

661
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:49,440
and it would go around the bottom of the Christmas tree,

662
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,580
not in the branches,but just on the ground, and it caught fire. Dan:Oh.

663
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,872
Vanessa:And my dad said one of his first memories

664
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,295
is him as a little kid,

665
00:42:56,295 --> 00:43:02,708
getting a cup of water and throwing it on the Christmas tree fire. This is huge hazard. And there's so many warnings.

666
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:11,533
Dan:I mean,I don't think so much anymore. Vanessa:Yeah,this is a big deal. Dan:Christmas trees are safe. Vanessa:Christmas trees are not safe, because they say now,

667
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:15,255
I think it's more known now that you should always keep water,

668
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:17,664
so you have the Christmas tree that's cut

669
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:20,506
and you put it in a little basin of water,

670
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:22,636
and if there's not water in there,

671
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:25,831
the tree will dry out and it will catch fire really easily.

672
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,010
But,if it's filled with water,

673
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:35,523
then the tree is hydrated and it won't catch fire as easily. Dan:But also,60 s electronics, versus Vanessa:Okay.That's true. Dan:Today's electronics.

674
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:38,960
They're not going to catch fire the same way. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:Probably. Vanessa:Yeah.

675
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,768
Dan:Christmas trees are safe and the best. Vanessa:Dan loves Christmas trees. So,I remember,yeah, we would do that,

676
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:46,607
and then we would decorate the tree.

677
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:49,385
And my mom always had one ornament, which I now have

678
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:52,270
that was the first ornament we put on the tree. Dan:Which one was that?

679
00:43:52,270 --> 00:44:02,240
Vanessa:It's the ball that has lots of little beads on it. And it's got Dan:Ball with beads. Vanessa:Ribbons,and knots,and stuff on it.

680
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,556
We have it. Dan:Well,I love Christmas trees

681
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,732
and I can't remember this ornament. Vanessa:Oh,well it's in our house. Dan:That's good.

682
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,137
It'll be refreshing this year to see it later.

683
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:13,642
Vanessa:And,she put that on the tree and that signified,

684
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:15,345
we can start to decorate the tree.

685
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,352
So yeah,we would decorate the tree together

686
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:18,662
and it was just a nice time to do that.

687
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:20,072
Dan:How did you guys sit back

688
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:26,651
and not decorate the tree right away? Our children are like, Bah,get all the stuff. Put it on right away. Vanessa:Yeah,we did the ornaments.

689
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:27,984
We were busy doing the branches.

690
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:31,492
Dan:Maybe because it's two girls versus two boys. Vanessa:I don't know.

691
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:32,852
But,we did it and it was fun.

692
00:44:32,852 --> 00:44:34,384
And I remember when we got married,

693
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,381
that was my first real Christmas tree.

694
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:45,036
We went to a place and got a real tree and Dan:That was your first? Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:Oh,we got the little one. Vanessa:We got a little tree. Yeah.

695
00:44:45,036 --> 00:44:46,960
Dan:That we planted later. Vanessa:Oh,yeah.

696
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,705
Dan:That's another thing you can do sometimes in America, but it's more difficult.

697
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:53,626
Vanessa:Yeah,you can get it with the root ball on the bottom.

698
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,920
The first year we were married Dan:It's a lot heavier.

699
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,036
Vanessa:Oh my goodness,it was so heavy.

700
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:02,932
I remember it took three of us. Dan:It was three feet tall. Vanessa:Me,you,and your brother

701
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:08,506
to take it out of the car and drag it into our house. Dan:Mm hmm affirmative Vanessa:Because it was so big,

702
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,416
but we wanted to plant it later,

703
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,517
we didn't want to just cut a tree down.

704
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:15,120
So,we got this tree with a root ball, but ever since then,

705
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,492
we've just gotten a cut tree,

706
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:20,289
and put it in our house, and decorated it.

707
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:24,320
And yeah,it's a lot of fun. Dan:Always a happy time. Vanessa:Yeah.

708
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,240
Well,I want to know for you,

709
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,875
what is your favorite holiday tradition?

710
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,768
It might not be about Christmas.

711
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:32,472
It could be about any holiday.

712
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,573
But,I want to know about your experience.

713
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:38,082
Let us know in the comments, what's your favorite holiday tradition?

714
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:40,436
And we'll go on to our next question.

715
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:43,432
Question number nine is about sports and exercise.

716
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,303
What is the most recent sport that you did?

717
00:45:47,303 --> 00:45:50,443
Dan:Well,this happened just about a week ago actually.

718
00:45:50,443 --> 00:46:00,617
And it's the first time I ever did this outdoors. It was rock climbing. Is this a sport? I guess,it's a sport. Vanessa:It's considered exercise. Dan:Yeah.

719
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:02,714
And so,my brother in law is,

720
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,180
let's just say,obsessed with rock climbing.

721
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,999
And,he's gotten pretty good at it lately.

722
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:13,410
And so,he met us in between where he lives and us.

723
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:18,616
We live about eight hours away. And,we were in West Virginia,

724
00:46:18,616 --> 00:46:21,246
which has actually a lot of good rock climbing.

725
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:24,080
And we chose a spot and he had all the gear,

726
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,480
he's got the ropes,he's got the shoes,

727
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:33,832
he's got the backpacks,he's got the harness, and all this stuff. And he actually... Oh the helmet too. Don't forget the helmet.

728
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,513
And,he geared me up to do it.

729
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:40,077
And,I was actually pretty nervous about it,

730
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,883
and not because I'm afraid of heights

731
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,591
actually,he's more scared of Heights than I am.

732
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,848
I think it's funny that he likes doing this so much.

733
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:53,480
He says every single time he does it,he's scared. Vanessa:Oh. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:Interesting.

734
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,050
Dan:But I'm not afraid of heights,

735
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,107
so I wasn't really worried about that.

736
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:00,720
I probably should have been more worried about it. Vanessa:What were you worried about? Dan:

737
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,360
I'm a perfectionist,or a completionist.

738
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,530
So,it really bothers me if I try something and I can't finish it.

739
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,314
Vanessa:Ah,so you wanted to be able to make it to the top.

740
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,520
Dan:So,I knew I could probably do some easy stuff,

741
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,815
but he's a lot better than I am.

742
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:23,144
So,I knew that he would be wanting to move on to something more challenging.

743
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:27,326
And,I didn't really know if I wanted to have to just watch,

744
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:29,251
or try it and only get partway.

745
00:47:29,251 --> 00:47:31,092
In the end,I did do that.

746
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:33,163
So,the first one was a easy one.

747
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:35,188
I don't think it was Vanessa:

748
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:39,753
I'll show you a picture here of Dan making it all the way to the top. Yes. Dan:Yes.

749
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:45,589
So,I do naturally have a good body type for climbing. I'm lightweight.

750
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:48,129
I climb a lot of trees.

751
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:53,979
I like to hike and do all that stuff. So,I can figure it out.

752
00:47:53,979 --> 00:47:59,733
But,the hand strength is just on another level to rock climb. Vanessa:Yeah.

753
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:03,170
Dan:And so,I did the easier one and I made it to the top.

754
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,834
But,all the other ones,I made it partway.

755
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,930
And,I actually remember,we were with another guy too, his name was Jim. And,Jim was really inspiring,because...

756
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,229
And don't worry,this was totally safe.

757
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:18,585
There was a rope tied to the very top.

758
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:23,288
They call it top climbing?Top rope? I don't remember the terms.

759
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:25,760
There's a lot of terms in rock climbing. Vanessa:Yeah.

760
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,104
Dan:And so,he was tied to the top

761
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:31,380
and if you fall that will catch you right away

762
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,275
and it's not a big deal. Vanessa:Yeah.

763
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:41,514
Dan:But,for me,if I fall one time doing that, I'm like,All right,I'm done. That's how I feel.

764
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,436
But he fell probably 15 times on a climb

765
00:48:44,436 --> 00:48:47,352
and just kept on trying,and trying,and trying,

766
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,872
and he made it to the top and I was like,Wow. And,when he got down,I said, I have to try

767
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,303
a lot more than I would,

768
00:48:57,303 --> 00:48:58,980
because I just saw him persevere.

769
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,493
So,it's a very good perseverance sport. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:So,I tried,and tried,and tried,

770
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:10,120
and I got one third of the way, because it was really difficult. It's called crack climbing.

771
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,265
And there's just a crack in the wall.

772
00:49:12,265 --> 00:49:16,555
And,you got to put your hands there. And,just Vanessa:That's so hard.

773
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:22,459
Dan:There's nothing except for a crack and little tiny ledges.

774
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:27,952
So,their experienced,so they got up the first part really easily.

775
00:49:27,952 --> 00:49:30,712
So,the girl who was with us,she said,

776
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,675
Yeah,that was tricky. But,I was stuck on the first part for...

777
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,400
It felt like 20 minutes,

778
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,560
it was probably more like 10 minutes.

779
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,240
They just got up that part.

780
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,153
But it was literally just a little thin rock

781
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:48,555
you had to put your fingers in, barely any foothold.

782
00:49:48,555 --> 00:49:50,670
But,I saw Jim fall,and fall,and fall,

783
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,086
and I kept on trying and I finally did it. Yes. Vanessa:Wow.

784
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:59,675
Man,that is not up my alley at all. Dan:Yeah. Brad asked me... Brad's my brother in law.

785
00:49:59,675 --> 00:49:59,855
He said,Do you think Vanessa would ever do this with you?

786
00:49:59,855 --> 00:50:00,902
And I was like Dan:Brad's my brother in law.

787
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:03,880
He said,Do you think Vanessa would ever do this with you?

788
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,880
And I was like,I don't think...

789
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,108
I can't imagine you wanting to do that. Vanessa:Yeah.

790
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:11,961
I don't like heights like that,

791
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:17,033
and I feel like I can't just do something like that like you.

792
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,715
I would need to go to the climbing gym and feel comfortable with it, because at least for me,

793
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:31,429
that takes a lot of upper body strength, your abs,your arms,your fingers. I think

794
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,496
maybe for you, you were able to make it to the top of the easier one

795
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:42,049
and halfway up or a third of the way up the other ones

796
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:45,213
because you're not afraid of heights

797
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:49,146
and your strength is distributed differently than mine. Dan:Yes.

798
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,127
Vanessa:But I think for something like that,

799
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:55,919
I would need to massively feel more comfortable with heights

800
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,984
and go to the gym in advance.

801
00:50:56,984 --> 00:51:01,480
Dan:The girl who was with us was the best one there. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:She was amazing. Vanessa:I bet. Dan:Yeah.

802
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,808
Vanessa:I mean,you can practice that and do it. Dan:Women can definitely do it. Vanessa:Yeah. That's the cool thing.

803
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:09,306
Dan:She was kind of like spider monkey,though. Vanessa:Going everywhere.

804
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:12,240
Dan:She hadn't had any children yet. Vanessa:Yeah,maybe.

805
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,116
Dan:Children does a number on you. I speak from experience. Vanessa:Yeah?

806
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:21,020
In any case,I think that seems like the kind of exercise

807
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,220
or sport that I would need to practice in advance

808
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,920
before going outside to do it,

809
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,256
and inside where there's,I don't know, maybe more predictability Dan:Mats.

810
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,075
Vanessa:or practice,that would be better for me.

811
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,722
Dan:I thought it was more fun outside. Vanessa:Yeah.

812
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:45,488
Dan:Because I've done climbing gyms before, and it's okay, but outside's a whole adventure. It did take forever though. Vanessa:Yeah.

813
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:47,505
You have to hook up everything.

814
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,836
Dan:We did four climbs and we were there all day.

815
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,220
You're watching other people go,

816
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:01,120
and also one person has to be the... I forget what it's called. Vanessa:Belay. Dan:Belay. Yeah. One person's holding you,

817
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,596
making sure you're not going to fall down,

818
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:06,070
so they actually hold you up from the other end.

819
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,397
Vanessa:Cool. Dan:I don't know all the terms, but you can imagine it,right? Vanessa:Yeah.

820
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:15,490
It seemed like cool camaraderie too with everybody who was there. Dan:Yeah.

821
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,476
That was probably the best part.

822
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,400
Vanessa:As in we all went together,

823
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,080
and then I went on a hike

824
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,200
with Dan's sister and our kids and Dan's parents.

825
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,242
We were at the same place, but hiking instead. But we were going back and watching them too.

826
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:34,453
It seemed like everyone who was in this area climbing just was chill.

827
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:38,840
They were all the type of perseverant, motivated type of person,

828
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,482
who's like,I'm going to climb this rock, a personal challenge. Dan:It's a culture,for sure. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:Yeah.

829
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:49,930
One guy walked up and there was a climb, they all have funny names, and he was like, Did you do chalk line?Cool,bro.

830
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:59,990
It was totally Vanessa:Trying to size each other up. Dan:Surfer vibes. Vanessa:Yeah. I could see that. Well,sounds like a fun time, even though it was hard. Dan:Oh,it twas very hard.

831
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,720
Very hard. Vanessa:Bonding together. Dan:Yes. How about you?

832
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,226
Have you tried any sports recently? Vanessa:Yeah,

833
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:07,276
I was trying to think about this,

834
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,208
and the answer is not really, but Dan:Baseball.

835
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:17,138
Vanessa:I was going to say baseball. Dan:Really? Vanessa:Because our four year old, almost five year old,

836
00:53:17,138 --> 00:53:22,142
maybe by the time you're watching this he'll be five,

837
00:53:22,142 --> 00:53:27,826
our five year old son has been into hitting the baseball with a baseball bat lately.

838
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,252
In June,we visited Pittsburgh when Dan went Dan:Rock climbing. Vanessa:rock climbing.

839
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:37,917
After that,we went to a baseball field with

840
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,327
Dan's sister and their cousins and some family,little kids.

841
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:52,055
We tried to kind of play a baseball field. Dan:Tried. Yes. Vanessa:There's bases, and we were all hitting. The kids hit,we hit,

842
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:55,393
and I've always liked hitting a baseball. I think it's pretty fun.

843
00:53:55,393 --> 00:54:01,341
Dan:That's when you realize how many rules there are in baseball. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:Don't run with the bat. First base is over there.

844
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:02,692
No,you have to stop on the base.

845
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:05,702
Wait,he's going to throw the ball to you. It's like,forget about it.

846
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,556
Just let him hit the ball. Vanessa:Yeah.

847
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:11,168
It was really funny to see our son hit the ball.

848
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:13,748
He was just so excited that he hit it

849
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,265
that he was holding onto the bat

850
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:24,180
and he ran to third base. Like,No,no,no. That way drop the bat. Go that way. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:We were just having fun. Yeah,it was fun, and I like hitting. Yeah.

851
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:30,240
I've always liked hitting a baseball. Even though it wasn't organized, like an actual organized sport,

852
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,398
I think that was still a sport. It wasn't too much exercise, but it was fun.

853
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,980
Dan:I have a funny story about baseball. Can I share it? Vanessa:Yes. Dan:When I was a kid. Vanessa:Go ahead. Dan:When I was a kid,

854
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,625
I played baseball up until coach pitch,

855
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:46,096
which is where the coach is pitching, not the players.

856
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:49,360
Then I started getting scared of how fast the ball was coming.

857
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,660
At least back then,that's how I felt.

858
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,910
But one time I was the first baseman,

859
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:59,600
and in baseball,it's a very slow sport,right?

860
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,360
For kids,you just start getting distracted

861
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,033
when they're not hitting the ball

862
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,728
and you're just waiting out there.

863
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,988
So,I was pretending to be Darth Vader

864
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,320
with earth fader with my glove over my face.

865
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,920
I was literally standing on first base going,

866
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,797
and the player hit the ball

867
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:20,394
and hit me on the glove,

868
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,344
and we totally missed the play

869
00:55:22,344 --> 00:55:30,905
and it was because I was pretending to be Darth Vader on first base. Vanessa:There you go. Dan:That's my story. Vanessa:Wow. Dan:That's why I quit baseball. Vanessa:Oh,man. Dan:Actually,that's not why.

870
00:55:30,905 --> 00:55:33,612
Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:It's because I would practice with my brother

871
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,181
and he would throw really hard

872
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:38,713
and I didn't want to get hit by the ball. Vanessa:Yeah. I mean,I don't blame you. Dan:Baseball.

873
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:41,294
Vanessa:I wouldn't want to get hit by a baseball either.

874
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:47,361
In the US,it's pretty common for kids to do, they call it little league, so there's different stages,

875
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:51,810
and one stage might be like a parent is throwing the ball to the kids,

876
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,113
or it's sitting on a tee,

877
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:54,790
it's sitting on a little stand

878
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,044
and the kids just have to try to hit the ball.

879
00:55:57,044 --> 00:56:00,041
Then the next level might be another player is throwing it,

880
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,034
or then the coach is throwing it

881
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:04,051
as you get more and more advanced.

882
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:12,850
So,it's kind of working you up to being a better player. Dan:To the majors. Vanessa:To the majors. Well,that was your first answer,right?

883
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,710
You wished you could be a famous sports player.

884
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:22,091
Dan:I'd take the best baseball player, or just really great. Vanessa:Cool. Okay. Dan:Yeah. Any sport. I love sport.

885
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:25,124
Vanessa:Well,I want to ask you the same question.

886
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:28,075
What was the most recent sport that you've played?

887
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,972
It could be an organized sport like baseball,

888
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:34,042
or it could be something that's just more exercise, like Dan:Like rock climbing. Vanessa:rock climbing,

889
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,989
but some people might say it's a sport.

890
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:37,168
Let us know in the comments

891
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,896
what's the most recent sport you've played,

892
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,480
and we'll go on to our next question.

893
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,416
Question number 10 is about electronics. This is another hypothetical question.

894
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:49,960
If you could invent any new electronic device,

895
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,040
what would it be and what would it do?

896
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,445
Dan:When I first was thinking about this,

897
00:56:57,445 --> 00:57:03,562
I thought gadgets,like a new toaster that never burnt the toast. Vanessa:Okay.

898
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:07,405
Dan:But I think when I think of noble uses

899
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:11,413
for electronics,I think of the medical field.

900
00:57:11,413 --> 00:57:18,466
My electronic invention would be a tiny robot that kills cancer. Vanessa:Oh,okay.

901
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:23,505
Dan:A cancer killing search and destroy robot. Vanessa:Wow.That's noble.

902
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:26,444
Dan:I think they might be working on this.

903
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,056
Vanessa:Yeah.I don't know much about that field.

904
00:57:28,056 --> 00:57:32,915
Dan:I think there is some kind of tiny robot,

905
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:36,085
for lack of a better word,

906
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:40,210
that can find certain diseases or cells in the body.

907
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:44,470
You know,I do not have a background in biotech at all,

908
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,114
but I would almost guarantee somebody's trying to figure out

909
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:54,663
how to get tiny robots that can find and kill cancer in people. Vanessa:That sounds great.

910
00:57:54,663 --> 00:58:00,240
Dan:That would be probably the best use of an electronic gadget.

911
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,076
Vanessa:Mine is very selfish compared to that.

912
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,872
Dan:Yeah,because nothing sucks more than cancer,

913
00:58:05,872 --> 00:58:11,020
I think.This is just the worst thing. Vanessa:Yeah.Well,if you are in biotech

914
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,964
or if you are a cancer related doctor or surgeon

915
00:58:14,964 --> 00:58:20,210
Dan:Send me your number and I'll tell you my plans. Vanessa:Yeah.Let us know. Does something like this exists?

916
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,072
Is this something that's in the works?

917
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,891
Yeah.Never know. Dan:Yeah.How about you? How many cancer destroying things

918
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:31,120
are you creating in your spare time? Vanessa:Oh,sorry.Mine's very selfish.

919
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,529
I was thinking more personal.

920
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:43,810
In our house,to go to our deck, we have a sliding door. There's a glass sliding door,

921
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,627
and then there's a screen that you can just push through.

922
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,861
It's a magnet,you can just go through it.

923
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:52,312
But in the summer,we try to keep the glass sliding door closed

924
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:55,271
because there's air conditioning in our house

925
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:58,331
and it's super hot and muggy,humid outside,

926
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:01,251
so we don't want that air to get inside.

927
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:03,412
We want it to stay cool inside.

928
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:06,383
We go in and out a lot in our house.

929
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,518
With young children,it's kind of tricky

930
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:16,775
to get them to keep that glass door closed. It's also kind of heavy. Dan:The sliding door.

931
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:19,023
Vanessa:Yeah,for them to pull it open is okay,

932
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,753
and then they bust through the screen door

933
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:23,516
and they're outside like,I'm going to go do something,

934
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:25,752
and they don't think about the glass door.

935
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,824
And for me too,sometimes if I'm carrying something,

936
00:59:28,824 --> 00:59:29,916
I have to open the door.

937
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,148
My electronic gadget would be a button

938
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:37,437
that you can push that would open the door,

939
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,444
and then automatically within 30 seconds, it would close the door,

940
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:45,694
so you have time to go through and it would close.

941
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:47,584
It might be sensor by your body,

942
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,520
so if you're still in the doorway it wouldn't close,

943
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,120
but that way it would always close behind us.

944
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:59,200
Dan:Couldn't you just use in the grocery store where it automatically opens? Vanessa:Yeah,something like that. Dan:A sliding automatic door.

945
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,499
Vanessa:But people don't have that in their house.

946
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:04,010
Dan:Oh.But it's only a matter of money.

947
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:07,758
Vanessa:I mean,maybe we could get something like that installed in our house now,

948
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,584
but I was kind of envisioning,

949
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:13,232
I imagine people who are handicapped or in a wheelchair,

950
01:00:13,232 --> 01:00:16,086
maybe they have something like this that's automatic. Dan:Probably.

951
01:00:16,086 --> 01:00:18,530
Vanessa:I'm sure it's a big system you have to install.

952
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,109
It's probably a lot of money or kind of a hassle,

953
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,790
but I'm sure there's some kind of system.

954
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,450
Dan:Well,we could go to a closed down grocery store,

955
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,090
and every time it opens,it says,Welcome to Aldi.

956
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,520
Vanessa:As in we would take Aldi's doors? Dan:Yeah.

957
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,823
Vanessa:And put them in our house,

958
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:37,034
and it would have a speaker that says, Welcome to the grocery store,

959
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,703
every time we open our house's doors?

960
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:43,196
Dan:It'd be the most charming thing we could possibly add to our home.

961
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,954
Vanessa:Maybe we could have it say,Welcome home,Vanessa. Dan:Oh,yeah.Programmable.

962
01:00:47,954 --> 01:00:51,100
Vanessa:I don't think I would like my doors to talk.

963
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,160
Dan:And it also takes off your hat. Vanessa:Wow. Dan:With an arm.

964
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,360
Vanessa:Maybe it also feeds you food and gives you water.

965
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,720
Dan:And it's a conveyor belt too,

966
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,450
so you don't have to walk through it.

967
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,781
Vanessa:And maybe it is also your brain,

968
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:02,653
so you don't have to think.

969
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:07,862
Dan:And there's another arm that puts a soda in your hand. Vanessa:That's weird.

970
01:01:07,862 --> 01:01:13,717
Yes.I would like our glass sliding door to be closed more easily

971
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:16,758
so that it is not a personal hassle

972
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:19,181
or an annoyance in our home.

973
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:24,850
But I must say that Dan's cancer fighting robots are probably a better idea.

974
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:29,440
Anyway,I thought about this question for about 4.2 seconds.

975
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,538
Dan:And I thought of it for four minutes. Vanessa:Okay. Dan:To be fair. Vanessa:Yeah.

976
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:35,996
So,maybe if I thought about it for four minutes

977
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:39,100
I would've come up with a better idea. Anyway,what about you?

978
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,831
What kind of new electronic gadget would you like to invent, and what would it do?

979
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,289
Let us know in the comments

980
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,360
and we'll go to our next question.

981
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,430
Question number 11 is about money.

982
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,172
I'd like to know what is something

983
01:01:53,172 --> 01:02:04,345
that you can justify spending more money on and why? Dan:Yeah.Justify. I mean,probably speakers. Vanessa:We always talk about speakers. Dan:I'm kidding.

984
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,955
I like audio stuff a lot.

985
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,256
I would say maybe once a year

986
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:15,058
I just start looking into some audio equipment or some kind of electronics,usually.

987
01:02:15,058 --> 01:02:21,602
I'm like,Vanessa,do you think we could? She's like,No,we have 10 speakers, or headphones or something. You know?

988
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:23,303
Vanessa:We talked about this in past videos.

989
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:28,144
Dan:Yes.This is not actually my answer. I said property. Vanessa:Oh,

990
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:39,624
Dan:Yeah,because I know for sure we want to have another property. Vanessa:Like in the woods? Dan:Yes. We would like to own, it might just be land,

991
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,836
but maybe just a cabin.

992
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,878
This is a little bit nostalgic for me

993
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:49,674
because my grandfather actually gave my parents

994
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,995
or I guess gave us access to a very simple cabin

995
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:56,312
that we would go to in the mountains in Colorado,

996
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,980
and that was our little escape from the hubbub

997
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,664
of normal life going to that cabin. Vanessa:No electricity,no plumbing. Dan:Yes,

998
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,600
but it has to be like that.

999
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,368
It has to be off grid,basically. I mean,it had electricity. Vanessa:Oh,

1000
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,200
Dan:But it didn't have running water. Vanessa:Ah,that was a thing.

1001
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:24,305
Dan:I mean,I think I'd take electricity. That's kind of nice. Vanessa:That is nice. Dan:I don't know. We'll debate the details later,

1002
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:28,224
but I know for sure I want to have some more property.

1003
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:36,224
You can always justify it by saying, Well,this is an investment too. You can always resell it.

1004
01:03:36,224 --> 01:03:44,160
Usually with property you'll at least make back what you bought it for. Vanessa:Hopefully. Dan:Especially in this area, it's always growing,

1005
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,834
so I can make a lot of justifications

1006
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:53,885
for why we need to own many beach homes. I mean Vanessa:Mountain Dan:mountain homes. Vanessa:cabins. Yeah. When you were a kid Dan:Many.

1007
01:03:53,886 --> 01:03:58,484
Vanessa:you would just go to the mountains with your mom and siblings

1008
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:01,223
and play in the woods and catch critters. Dan:Yeah.

1009
01:04:01,223 --> 01:04:02,765
There was acres of land there.

1010
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:06,772
There wasn't as many critters as I would've liked there. Vanessa:Oh, Dan:But there was a pond

1011
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:11,880
and there were dragon flies and fish. Vanessa:Oh,that sounds fun. Dan:Yeah.

1012
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,658
Vanessa:I think that's a beautiful childhood too,

1013
01:04:14,658 --> 01:04:17,830
being able to do stuff like that. We go hiking a lot,

1014
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,120
but there's something special about staying there. Dan:Yeah.

1015
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,705
Vanessa:In the cabin and you go back to the same place, maybe different seasons,

1016
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:28,763
and get to know the seasons there. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:That's cool. Dan:Yeah.

1017
01:04:28,763 --> 01:04:34,185
The best thing about the cabin that we had was it had a loft.

1018
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:37,515
It doesn't seem very safe thinking back to it,

1019
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:39,939
because my memory of it is

1020
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:45,814
it was like a plywood deck hanging from the ceiling. Vanessa:Did it have a Dan:It was hanging down,

1021
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:49,128
and you climbed a ladder up to it. It had plywood walls,

1022
01:04:49,128 --> 01:04:51,438
but there were gaps in the walls too,

1023
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:56,513
where you could just jump down, which we didn't jump down. But what we did was

1024
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,585
because it was a one room cabin,

1025
01:04:58,585 --> 01:05:03,079
if my parents were there with some friends or my grandparents, they would play cards,

1026
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:07,035
and they would send us to bed, but we could hear everything, so we'd spy on them

1027
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:11,037
and we'd drop stuff down on them and stuff. Vanessa:That sounds fun. Dan:Yeah. That was fun.

1028
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:16,055
Vanessa:Wow,so maybe we can recreate this rustic experience. Dan:We need a loft.

1029
01:05:16,055 --> 01:05:18,873
Vanessa:Do you think it would be just as fun as an adult?

1030
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:27,120
Because you were a kid doing it, do you think that Dan:To sleep in the loft? Vanessa:Well,for us, because we're adults now, so having this rural experience,

1031
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,120
would it be as fun for us as it would Dan:I think it would be. Vanessa:as for kids? Dan:Yeah,

1032
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,387
because one benefit of being in a place like America

1033
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:38,679
and the United States is that you can usually find

1034
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:43,632
some place that is very rural and quiet. Vanessa:Quickly and close.

1035
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:46,648
Dan:We live close enough to a highway and stuff

1036
01:05:46,648 --> 01:05:52,418
that it would be nice to just only hear the birds chirping. Vanessa:Yeah. I think that's really possible. I mean

1037
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:54,650
Dan:And get away from electronics and stuff.

1038
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,740
It would have to be an intentional,

1039
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,725
this is not a place where we have a TV,for example. Vanessa:Yeah.

1040
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:03,355
I think you can drive about 20 minutes away

1041
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:06,240
from our house and be very much in the woods. Dan:Yes.

1042
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:14,879
Vanessa:But anyway,that's a specific discussion for another time. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Cool. So,you'd like to have Dan:More property. Vanessa:a cabin,

1043
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:16,429
and that would be a investment,

1044
01:06:16,429 --> 01:06:18,152
an investment that you could justify.

1045
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,030
Well,I think for me, when I thought about this,

1046
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:26,072
I thought more of something that we already do

1047
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,720
that we have justified spending more money on, so Dan:Garden boxes.

1048
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,275
Vanessa:I spend too much money on the garden. That's true.

1049
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,439
These are the world's most expensive tomatoes.

1050
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:40,767
Dan:We are now a small scale farm.

1051
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,063
Vanessa:That's not what I was saying, but that is true.

1052
01:06:44,063 --> 01:06:48,258
I thought of something more in our daily life.

1053
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:51,077
I think this is different for everyone

1054
01:06:51,077 --> 01:06:53,896
depending on how much money you have.

1055
01:06:53,896 --> 01:06:58,929
At some point in our marriage, we bought the cheapest food.

1056
01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:03,630
This is all that we could afford and that was it.

1057
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:06,271
But then as we made more money,

1058
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:13,244
we wanted to intentionally buy better quality food. Dan:We prioritize it. Vanessa:Yeah.

1059
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:17,405
So,instead of just buying expensive food, we wanted to buy,

1060
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:20,269
especially we kind of made an intention

1061
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:25,301
to buy better quality animal products specifically. In the US,

1062
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,065
you have a lot of options.

1063
01:07:27,065 --> 01:07:31,385
You could buy organic carrots or conventional carrots,

1064
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:35,347
and not so much that I'm thinking more about meat

1065
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:42,240
and yogurt and cheese and milk Dan:Where the creatures are involved. Vanessa:Yeah,

1066
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
because in the area where we live,

1067
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,240
there's a lot of options for buying

1068
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,814
local grass fed beef,for example,

1069
01:07:49,814 --> 01:07:52,827
where there's a farm down the street

1070
01:07:52,827 --> 01:07:55,494
and it's much more expensive than

1071
01:07:55,494 --> 01:07:59,602
buying the cheapest beef at the grocery store.

1072
01:07:59,602 --> 01:08:03,115
But for us,as we've made more money,

1073
01:08:03,115 --> 01:08:06,395
this has been something that we justify spending more money on.

1074
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,037
If we didn't have money,

1075
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:14,309
then I would not spend money on that, because that wasn't a priority.

1076
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,578
Dan:It would be hot dogs and canned tuna. Vanessa:I mean,maybe not hot dogs,

1077
01:08:18,578 --> 01:08:23,366
but some beans or just rice, something very simple. Dan:Rice and beans. There you go. Vanessa:Yeah.

1078
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,802
You can live off of that. Lots of people do.

1079
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:27,630
But for us,this has been something

1080
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:31,835
that we have been intentional about. When we buy milk, we try to buy

1081
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,999
good quality, not just expensive,

1082
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:47,040
but either local milk or something that's whole milk, grass fed,something local, these types of things. We have our own chickens, so those are certainly Dan:They're free range.

1083
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,097
Vanessa:Beautiful quality eggs. But this type of thing,

1084
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:55,109
because I feel like it is directly impacting

1085
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:58,787
the farming world and the animal's life.

1086
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,155
We are not vegan, we are not vegetarian,

1087
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:10,904
but I don't like conventional farms and factory farms,big scale farms.

1088
01:09:10,904 --> 01:09:16,168
Dan:From the standpoint of the animals? Vanessa:From a lot of standpoints, the environment,animals,all of that,

1089
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:20,194
maybe you're eating too much meat, but I completely understand that

1090
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:22,885
if you don't have much money, you buy food.

1091
01:09:22,885 --> 01:09:27,531
You just have to buy the food that you buy and you have to survive.

1092
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,590
Then as you make more money,

1093
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,600
you make different choices about what you buy.

1094
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,350
For us,that's been increasing the quality

1095
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,152
of the animal products that we buy

1096
01:09:38,152 --> 01:09:39,763
for a lot of different reasons.

1097
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:48,853
But anyway,that's something that I can justify spending more money on. Dan:Yes. Better food. Vanessa:Yeah. That's something that we've chosen

1098
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:51,096
to spend more money on over time.

1099
01:09:51,096 --> 01:09:53,150
That is probably different for you.

1100
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,760
Let us know in the comments

1101
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,756
for you,what is something that you can justify spending more money on, maybe in the future,

1102
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:01,993
like Dan's answer,some cabin or property,

1103
01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:04,514
you could justify spending more money on that,

1104
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:06,662
or maybe it's something that you already

1105
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:08,652
spend more money on,like my answer.

1106
01:10:08,652 --> 01:10:12,715
Let us know in the comments. I'm curious. What are your financial priorities?

1107
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,945
Let us know in the comments,

1108
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:17,027
and let's go to the next question.

1109
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:19,111
Question number 11 is about games.

1110
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:24,933
We like games. Dan:Games.Are they fun? Vanessa:Yes. Dan:I don't know. Vanessa:I would like to know

1111
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:28,488
what is a game that you play that you're very competitive about.

1112
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:30,840
The word competitive means you want to win.

1113
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,690
You feel serious,you can still have fun, but you want to win.

1114
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,426
Dan:The real question for me is

1115
01:10:36,426 --> 01:10:39,198
what is a game that I don't feel competitive about,

1116
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,632
because I have a game switch in my head.

1117
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:48,884
I start playing a game and I'm like, Strategy on,let's win this thing,

1118
01:10:48,884 --> 01:10:53,203
and I feel very competitive about it. I would say,especially any game

1119
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:56,023
that has strategy where you can actually

1120
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:59,754
make decisions that will really impact the game,

1121
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,914
there's a lot of games that are just roll the dice and it's random chance.

1122
01:11:02,914 --> 01:11:05,769
It's a little easier not to be competitive about that. Vanessa:Yeah.

1123
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:08,600
Dan:Like when I played shoots and ladders

1124
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,532
with my son the other day,

1125
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:14,607
100 luck,which he didn't necessarily understand.

1126
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:17,832
He was like,Look,I'm going to jump over the slide.

1127
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,060
Vanessa:You can't jump over the slide.

1128
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:22,080
Dan:That's not part of the rules.

1129
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,852
But that was very interesting

1130
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:31,866
that he thought about that himself. But anyway,yeah,the question is, what am I competitive Vanessa:Yeah.

1131
01:11:31,866 --> 01:11:32,930
Give an example of some games,

1132
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,393
because maybe our students too would like

1133
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:38,088
Dan:What am I super competitive about? Vanessa:Yeah. Maybe they'd like some examples that they could play.

1134
01:11:38,088 --> 01:11:42,145
Dan:A recent example is there's a game called Code Names,

1135
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:47,350
and it's one of the best games ever, I think. Vanessa:Actually,I have a YouTube video

1136
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,295
where Dan and I play this

1137
01:11:48,295 --> 01:11:49,510
and I teach you how to play it

1138
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:53,001
and teach you vocabulary along the way. Dan:Is very challenging,

1139
01:11:53,001 --> 01:12:00,964
it scales,so if your group is very smart, they'll play it very smart. If your group is dumb,

1140
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:03,670
it plays to the level of the players.

1141
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,005
I've had to train myself not to get competitive about this game,

1142
01:12:10,005 --> 01:12:12,458
because for example,we first played this.

1143
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:15,000
We literally went to bed that night

1144
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,034
and had an argument about it.

1145
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,112
Vanessa:But why did you say this thing? No,I meant that.

1146
01:12:19,112 --> 01:12:21,400
How could you not get this? Dan:Yeah.

1147
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,600
It feels really bad to lose that game, I think. Vanessa:Yeah.

1148
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,242
Dan:So,that one really got to me. The last time we played,

1149
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:32,058
I have to usually tell myself

1150
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:34,555
I'm not going to get super competitive.

1151
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,141
I'm just going to have a good time, and if I lose,that's okay. I have to prep myself

1152
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:43,056
because I really like to win games. Vanessa:Yeah. Yeah.

1153
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:46,112
Dan:Actually,I've gotten better with that over time. Vanessa:Yeah.

1154
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:52,076
I think Code Names is a good one for English learners. One that we play often

1155
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:58,400
or we play maybe three times a year is Settlers of Catan. Dan:Yes.

1156
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,019
Vanessa:You can play the simple version of sellers of Catan,

1157
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:05,832
or you can use the expansions. Dan:We go a little crazy. Vanessa:The original game,

1158
01:13:05,832 --> 01:13:12,188
it might take one and a half hours, but the way we play, sometimes it takes five hours,

1159
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:13,932
and it can be very intense.

1160
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,175
It depends on who you play with.

1161
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:19,894
I've played this game with people who are so serious

1162
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:22,739
that they are not fun to play with,

1163
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:32,080
as in if you set the dice down, they'll say,Oh,your turn's over. It's my turn now. What?Give me some slack. Cut me some slack.

1164
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,280
But when we play with us,

1165
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,080
and the people we usually play with

1166
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
is Dan's sister and her husband,Brad

1167
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:44,709
Dan:That's the only people we play with now. Vanessa:Dan rock climbed with,yeah, when we play with them, we're all competitive,but we're nice.

1168
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,760
Dan:We're lighthearted at the same time. Vanessa:Yeah.

1169
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,820
We have a good time still.

1170
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,620
Sometimes at the end of the game,

1171
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,228
when it's about two o'clock in the morning Dan:We've gad arguments though. Vanessa:Okay. We've had big arguments,

1172
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:55,320
the four of us about it.

1173
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,036
But when it's getting really late at night,

1174
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,159
everyone's really tired, and we know we have to wake up early with all of our kids,

1175
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:12,704
so it gets a little more stressful. But that's a fun one. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Those are neither Dan:You feel competitive about that? Vanessa:I feel competitive about Dan:You're a quiet competitor.

1176
01:14:12,704 --> 01:14:15,790
Vanessa:I feel competitive about those games,

1177
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:22,837
but I feel most competitive when I play Carcassonne. Dan:Oh,just against me? Vanessa:Against you,mainly because

1178
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:24,935
Dan:You beat me a lot too. Vanessa:That's why. Dan:I don't like it.

1179
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:29,436
Vanessa:Because I have probably a 50 chance of winning.

1180
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,649
A lot of games,depending on what they are,

1181
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:37,909
if I play them with just Dan, I either won't win often

1182
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,857
or it'll be like 30 of the time I'll win. But with Carcassonne,

1183
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:46,004
I win about 50 of the time. Dan:It's not just luck. Vanessa:It's not just luck.

1184
01:14:46,004 --> 01:14:48,511
There's a lot of work and strategy.

1185
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:50,233
If you miss up a move,

1186
01:14:50,233 --> 01:14:52,201
you can lose the entire game,

1187
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:54,648
and your three hour experience is lost.

1188
01:14:54,648 --> 01:14:57,063
I like Carcassonne a lot because of that.

1189
01:14:57,063 --> 01:14:58,470
It's fun to me,I can win.

1190
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,959
Dan:We can play one on one. Vanessa:We can play just us,

1191
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,274
and I think that's a good...

1192
01:15:04,135 --> 01:15:04,936
There's not many good strategy games

1193
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:07,045
that you can play with just two people.

1194
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,720
It's based off of a city in France, Carcassonne,the same name.

1195
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,776
And the game looks like that city.

1196
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:20,500
Dan:You build city walls and roads and stuff. Vanessa:Yeah. It's quite fun. There's also expansions on that. That can make it longer. Dan:Theo would love that game.

1197
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,946
Vanessa:I think he could play it. Dan:Yeah.

1198
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:24,771
We got to play that with my son. Vanessa:Yeah. That'd be fun. Anyway.

1199
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:26,184
Dan:He's going to like games too.

1200
01:15:26,184 --> 01:15:30,654
We're going to get in a lot of family arguments Vanessa:About being competitive. Actually.

1201
01:15:30,654 --> 01:15:38,099
He played Settlers of CATAN Jr. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:Which is the kid's version. Dan:He did amazing. Yesterday. Vanessa:Yesterday,for the first time

1202
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:43,920
and you were playing with him. Dan:I helped him a lot, but he still got it. Vanessa:Cool.

1203
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,575
That's a new phase in parenting. When we can Dan:He's not even five yet

1204
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,212
and he still sat through turns and listened to the rules

1205
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,865
and he looked at the little chart

1206
01:15:51,865 --> 01:16:01,137
and figured it out and stuff. Vanessa:That's cool. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:That sounds fun. I would Dan:It was impressive. Vanessa:I like little kid stuff, but I really like Dan:Big kid stuff.

1207
01:16:01,137 --> 01:16:02,735
Vanessa:playing baseball with your kids

1208
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:09,920
or playing Settlers of CATAN with your kids. Stuff that I enjoy too. Like for example, we're going to an aquarium

1209
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,404
for our five year old's birthday. I like aquariums

1210
01:16:13,404 --> 01:16:18,230
and this isn't something that's just for kids. It's for us too. And it's for his birthday.

1211
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:26,777
So a new stage of the Dan:The giant critter museum. Vanessa:That's Dan's favorite. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Anyway,that was a little detour.

1212
01:16:26,777 --> 01:16:28,128
So I want to know for you,

1213
01:16:28,128 --> 01:16:30,201
what game do you feel competitive about?

1214
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:33,325
Or maybe you are a non competitive person.

1215
01:16:33,325 --> 01:16:35,667
You play a game and you're like,

1216
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,998
I can win.I don't have to win.It's okay.

1217
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:39,932
Or maybe you are super competitive.

1218
01:16:39,932 --> 01:16:41,270
Let us know in the comments

1219
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,287
what's a game you feel competitive about

1220
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:48,336
and we'll go to our next question. Question.Number 13 is about celebrities

1221
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:58,320
or maybe they don't have to be celebrities. Interesting people. Dan:Famous people. Vanessa:This is a common Dan:Infamous people. Vanessa:question,common conversation question

1222
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,382
to spice things up. I'm having a special dinner party.

1223
01:17:03,382 --> 01:17:05,512
Who is someone dead or alive

1224
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,133
who you would like to invite? Dan:Yeah,

1225
01:17:08,133 --> 01:17:11,760
I feel like I've answered something similar to this recently. Vanessa:Oh,okay.

1226
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,805
Dan:And I give this answer a lot, so I'm very current.

1227
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:17,700
I just want to know what's going on in the world now.

1228
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,800
So I would just invite the current president. Okay. So Joe Biden,

1229
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,235
I would actually take Donald Trump too,

1230
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,138
just because I can't believe these people exist

1231
01:17:28,138 --> 01:17:30,364
and are so annoying and dumb.

1232
01:17:30,364 --> 01:17:33,506
I want to see what they're really like.

1233
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:39,327
Are they really as ridiculous and empty as they seem? Are they faking it?

1234
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:41,336
I want to ask them tough questions

1235
01:17:41,336 --> 01:17:47,505
and see if Joe Biden just falls asleep in the middle of dinner, or if Donald Trump just I guess he seems pretty Yeah.

1236
01:17:47,505 --> 01:17:49,431
He'd probably just blow if he ate something.

1237
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,860
But yeah, I want to get into their heads or try to,

1238
01:17:53,860 --> 01:18:00,700
and just see how ridiculous they are in real life. Because again Vanessa:You're just curious. Dan:I live my life

1239
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:05,125
and then I see these are the people running the country

1240
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,190
and I just can't put that

1241
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,080
together and it makes me feel upset usually.

1242
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,920
Vanessa:They don't seem like real people. Dan:Yeah.They're not.

1243
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,285
Vanessa:So having a dinner conversation with somebody

1244
01:18:18,285 --> 01:18:28,853
can bring out the real them, the real inside look. Dan:Sure.Oh yeah. That's another key element. I'd get them really drunk. Vanessa:Okay.

1245
01:18:28,853 --> 01:18:31,663
Dan:Got to spike their drinks a little bit more.

1246
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:33,347
And this is not what I'd really do,

1247
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,063
but this is the hypothetical world

1248
01:18:35,063 --> 01:18:38,880
where I get Donald Trump at my dinner table or Joe Biden. Vanessa:Okay.

1249
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,520
Dan:Joe Biden would just fall asleep. I'm convinced.

1250
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,896
He's old and just not with it. Vanessa:Okay.Well.

1251
01:18:44,896 --> 01:18:50,108
Dan:But he'd probably share a lot of information if you got them tipsy. Vanessa:That would be very interesting. Dan:Yeah.

1252
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:58,353
Just how close are your fingers to the nuclear buttons,Mr.President? Vanessa:Do we want to know? Dan:No. Vanessa:Well,

1253
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:00,948
I feel like for my answer to this question,

1254
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:03,111
I chose to go much more personal.

1255
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,398
And that's usually when I think about this question, I always think that more. Dan:

1256
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,107
This is the difference between you and me. Vanessa:Yeah.

1257
01:19:13,107 --> 01:19:17,752
Because if I met with the current or past presidents of the US,

1258
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,692
I don't know what I would do with that information.

1259
01:19:21,692 --> 01:19:30,267
Okay,so this is what they're like now, what do I do? Dan:Share it to the world. Vanessa:But I think Dan:Nobody'd believe you. Vanessa:I would be very interested

1260
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:36,421
from a personal standpoint to meet, on my question number one I mentioned Antoinette Menifee,

1261
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:40,783
my great grandma who came from Italy. I would be very interested

1262
01:19:40,783 --> 01:19:43,944
to sit down and have a conversation at dinner with her. Dan:That would be very interesting.

1263
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:45,998
Vanessa:What kind of woman is she

1264
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:53,071
that she met a random man, moved to another country, left her family, never saw them again

1265
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:59,392
and raised six children in the US? And here we are. Dan:I have a question. Vanessa:I'd be very interested.

1266
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:01,291
Dan:Would you go back in time

1267
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:05,594
or would she come to current time in this hypothetical universe?

1268
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,717
Vanessa:She would come to current times.

1269
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,956
Dan:So you want to show her the future? Vanessa:I wouldn't show her anything.

1270
01:20:11,956 --> 01:20:13,848
I would just be eating dinner with her

1271
01:20:13,848 --> 01:20:16,196
and she would have her entire life experience. Okay.

1272
01:20:16,196 --> 01:20:17,576
So I don't want her to be like,

1273
01:20:17,576 --> 01:20:21,241
so maybe it doesn't matter 90 years old when she can't remember things,

1274
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:23,079
but I don't want her to be 30 years old

1275
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:25,036
and she hasn't had a lot of experiences yet.

1276
01:20:25,036 --> 01:20:32,784
So this is a magical question. Dan:60? Vanessa:I don't know. Dan:How long did she live,anyways? Vanessa:I don't know. I met her when I Dan:You did?

1277
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:36,086
Vanessa:There's a picture of me on her lap as a baby. Dan:Oh.

1278
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:40,304
Vanessa:So she lived at least till like 1987,1988.

1279
01:20:40,304 --> 01:20:44,307
I don't know how old she was, but I'm sure she was Dan:She was probably pretty old.

1280
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:46,343
Vanessa:She had a lot of life experiences

1281
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:49,313
and I'm always curious about what life was like back then.

1282
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:52,517
And I think it would be a personal touch to be like,

1283
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:54,388
Oh,this was someone who is part of me

1284
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,193
and some roots. Anyway,that's my answer. So I'm curious for you,

1285
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,390
if you had a magical dinner party,

1286
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,456
who would you like to invite someone dead or alive?

1287
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:05,775
Let us know in the comments.

1288
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:07,085
I'm curious to see what you have to say

1289
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:08,395
and let's go to our next question.

1290
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,142
Vanessa:The 14 th question is about pets.

1291
01:21:11,142 --> 01:21:15,244
What kind of pet would you like to have? Dan:What kind of pet?

1292
01:21:15,244 --> 01:21:16,452
If I could have any pets.

1293
01:21:16,452 --> 01:21:24,780
Vanessa:If you could have any pet. Dan:In the world. Vanessa:Yes. Dan:That I don't already have. Vanessa:Well,we have chickens. Dan:We have cats and chickens. Vanessa:Tadpoles that turned into frogs,cats.

1294
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:28,976
Do we have anything else at the moment? Dan:Well,okay. I can think of one Vanessa:A caterpillar.

1295
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:31,493
Dan:that does not really fit our family. Vanessa:Okay.

1296
01:21:31,493 --> 01:21:40,133
Dan:And it is a smart dog that doesn't bark too much. Vanessa:Our child hates barking dogs. Dan:Well,I hate barking too. Vanessa:Yeah.

1297
01:21:40,133 --> 01:21:45,514
Dan:But I really like dogs to a degree. Certain dogs I really like,

1298
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:48,616
because I just feel like humans and dogs,

1299
01:21:48,616 --> 01:21:50,668
they really are man's best friend.

1300
01:21:50,668 --> 01:21:53,860
But when I think about how much work a dog takes

1301
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:58,180
and it's like almost taking on another family member. Vanessa:Oh yeah.

1302
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,824
Dan:And it just doesn't really fit.

1303
01:22:00,824 --> 01:22:06,293
Not to mention our oldest son is extremely afraid of dogs. Vanessa:Yeah.

1304
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:08,400
Dan:And he really,really does not like them. Vanessa:Yeah.

1305
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,717
If you have any tips about how to help kids feel more comfortable with dogs without traumatizing them, I need some help. Dan:Yeah.

1306
01:22:13,717 --> 01:22:18,975
Vanessa:Let me know in the comments. Dan:We're working on.It. It's a work in progress. Vanessa:Yep. Dan:But also,

1307
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,920
I don't think you like dogs as much as I do. Vanessa:Yeah.

1308
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,175
Dan:I don't think you would put it on a bucket list.

1309
01:22:25,175 --> 01:22:29,675
It's almost a bucket list thing for me to have a dog someday. A cool dog,

1310
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:41,448
like a Border Collie or an Australian Shepherd. Something that's noble,smart,fast, cunning and difficult to keep. Because border collies are notorious

1311
01:22:41,448 --> 01:22:48,298
for needing lots and lots of exercise. Vanessa:Yeah. If we were farmers,maybe. We worked on a farm. Dan:We're getting there.

1312
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:49,696
Vanessa:But we have a big garden.

1313
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:51,906
We worked on a farm in the south of France

1314
01:22:51,906 --> 01:22:53,266
and they had a Border Collie

1315
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,529
that was so fun and so smart.

1316
01:22:56,529 --> 01:23:00,944
Dan:You could see the intelligence in that dog's eyes. Vanessa:Oh yeah. That dog was amazing.

1317
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:09,594
But that dog was living in the perfect place. It had endless stimulation,endless exercise. Dan:Never went inside. Vanessa:That dog could work there. Yeah. It was great.

1318
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:14,898
But I think it's also smart to know what animals don't fit your life.

1319
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:18,128
And for us,at least at the moment,

1320
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:27,856
we have a lot of smart,fast running around creatures in our house called children. So we're at our capacity. Dan:Yes. Yeah.

1321
01:23:27,856 --> 01:23:31,843
And there's also more dogs that I actually dislike than like.

1322
01:23:31,843 --> 01:23:42,052
There's a lot of dogs I'm just like,No,thank you. Small yippy dogs,no. No,thanks. No. Vanessa:It's not your style. Dan:Not my thing. Vanessa:Yeah. Dan:It'd need to be bigger,smarter,noble,cunning.

1323
01:23:42,052 --> 01:23:46,653
These are the words that come to my mind when I think of a cool dog. Vanessa:Okay,yeah.

1324
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:51,840
A dog that helps you in some way too. A working dog,maybe. Dan:Sure. That's not even necessary.

1325
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,400
Just one that can catch a Frisbee. Vanessa:Oh,that sounds fun. Cool. Well,our kids are getting there.

1326
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,753
Did you have another one?

1327
01:23:59,753 --> 01:24:01,207
I thought you said you had a second one.

1328
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:11,840
Dan:Oh,well,so I also said some fish. Vanessa:Oh. Dan:Like a giant fish. Vanessa:What's giant mean? Dan:This is Vanessa:Like a whale? Dan:Both of these are unrealistic. Because you said any pet. Vanessa:Yeah.

1329
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,080
It's okay. We can dream.

1330
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,085
Dan:When you get into the aquarium world.

1331
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:18,145
Let me tell you about the aquarium world.

1332
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:21,120
You can get pretty detailed and intense about it.

1333
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,520
And there are some really cool fish.

1334
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,533
There's one,I think it's called a arowana. Vanessa:Okay.

1335
01:24:26,533 --> 01:24:30,226
Dan:I want to say,and they can get like this big.

1336
01:24:30,226 --> 01:24:31,530
Vanessa:What kind of tank do you have to have?

1337
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:34,570
Dan:They're shiny and they can be gold or red,

1338
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,240
but they'll literally sell for 10,000. Vanessa:What?

1339
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,120
And you probably have to have a tank the size of this room.

1340
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,225
Dan:And you need a big tank.

1341
01:24:42,225 --> 01:24:44,478
Probably not the size of the room. Vanessa:Oh my goodness.

1342
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,316
Dan:I wouldn't want to spend money on it.

1343
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,851
I'd never bring myself to spend money on it.

1344
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:49,213
Vanessa:You can't justify spending money on it.

1345
01:24:49,213 --> 01:24:53,155
Dan:If somebody just gave me the supplies and the fish,

1346
01:24:53,155 --> 01:25:05,896
I'd set it up and be happy. Vanessa:Okay. That's a good dream. Yeah. Like my dream. Dan:Yeah. How about you? Vanessa:I said Dan:A dinosaur. Vanessa:No,I said a cow. Dan:Oh. Vanessa:Yeah.

1347
01:25:05,896 --> 01:25:08,959
I think it would be cool to have a cow,but Dan:Daisy.

1348
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,240
Vanessa:The only way I would have a cow is if basically

1349
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:19,532
I was just the owner and someone else came every day to milk the cow.

1350
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,945
Somebody prepared,took care of the cow.

1351
01:25:21,945 --> 01:25:22,980
I don't want to take care of it.

1352
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:27,286
Dan:And in this scenario you're a noble woman. Vanessa:Yes. Dan:Living in her manor. Vanessa:Yes.

1353
01:25:27,286 --> 01:25:30,109
And I would say,Go take care of my cow down there. Basically.

1354
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:33,544
I just want lots of milk. Lots of milk Dan:Free milk. Vanessa:to make It's not free.

1355
01:25:33,544 --> 01:25:35,839
There's a lot of work into a cow. Dan:Okay. Not so free.

1356
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:45,958
Vanessa:I have to pay the person who takes care of the cow. Dan:You're not touching udders. Vanessa:Having endless amounts of yogurt,cheese,milk,

1357
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:53,162
that's from your fresh dairy cow. That's cool. But it's also extremely hard.

1358
01:25:53,162 --> 01:25:54,680
Dan:They poop all over your yard.

1359
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,868
Vanessa:Well,I don't even need to keep it in my yard. Dan:So do the chickens. Oh.

1360
01:25:57,868 --> 01:26:00,560
Vanessa:It would be on my farm. Dan:Oh.

1361
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,491
Vanessa:It would be in someone else's farm and I would just own that cow. Dan:On your manor.

1362
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:07,874
Vanessa:But there's actually,I was thinking about this the other day,

1363
01:26:07,874 --> 01:26:13,685
we stayed at an Airbnb that was a farm and they have some cows and horses and chickens

1364
01:26:13,685 --> 01:26:20,075
and they have a milk sharing program where you can buy part of the cow.

1365
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:25,185
So you're not actually like I buy the leg of the cow,that kind of thing. They're saying,if you

1366
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,934
buy part of the cow, the ownership of this cow,

1367
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:37,034
you will get a certain amount of milk per month from that cow. So it's what I'm thinking.

1368
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,720
You don't have to do any work,but you get the milk. Yeah. And you pay for it.

1369
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,897
But it's local and it's going back to justifying,

1370
01:26:45,897 --> 01:26:51,280
spending more money on high quality animal products. Dan:We could just do that.

1371
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,676
Vanessa:We eat a lot of yogurt and I hate to buy all the yogurt.

1372
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,736
We buy a bulk big yogurt container,

1373
01:26:56,736 --> 01:26:59,659
but we go through so many of those. We eat yogurt a lot.

1374
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:02,232
Our kids eat yogurt a lot. Dan:Our kids love yogurt. Vanessa:Yeah.

1375
01:27:02,232 --> 01:27:08,965
I think that if we had something like a milk sharing program,

1376
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:17,312
we would,or I would be more inclined to just make some yogurt in the Crockpot or something and have that at home. Anyway. Dan:That's a very Vanessa answer.

1377
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:20,811
Vanessa:That's a dream. Dan:A cow that you don't want to take care of.

1378
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:22,360
Vanessa:No,I don't want to take care of it.

1379
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:28,176
Dan:Those people that had the cow at the Airbnb, they looked really tired. Vanessa:They said Dan:They had three cows,two cows?

1380
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:37,475
Vanessa:They said the word we would use to describe having a cow is relentless. They said rain or shine, sick or not. Dan:You got to milk them.

1381
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:40,736
Vanessa:Christmas or Thanksgiving,any day,twice a day,

1382
01:27:40,736 --> 01:27:43,200
they have to go to the barn and milk that cow.

1383
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,718
Dan:Yeah.And it's just two people there.

1384
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,040
Vanessa:Yeah.They didn't hire anyone to help them,

1385
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,480
so they never get a vacation,

1386
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,747
which they could hire someone to help occasionally. Dan:I will just say Vanessa:Anyway.Not my style.

1387
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,476
Dan:I saw a twinge of regret in her eyes

1388
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,408
when she was talking about this decision. Vanessa:Yeah.They loved those cows

1389
01:27:57,408 --> 01:28:04,378
and they took good care of them. But they're like,Oh,this is relentless. Dan:Yeah.Because in their previous life, they weren't Well life.

1390
01:28:04,378 --> 01:28:07,280
Jobs or careers,they weren't farmers at all. Vanessa:Yeah.

1391
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:19,070
Dan:They made a conscious decision to go back to farming. Vanessa:Yeah.Anyway,that's my answer,a cow. Dan:That could be you. Vanessa:That could be me.We'll see. Anyway,what about you?

1392
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,626
What pet,if you could have any pet in the world,

1393
01:28:21,626 --> 01:28:24,389
or any animal really,it doesn't even have to be a pet,

1394
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,021
what would you have?Let us know in the comments.

1395
01:28:27,021 --> 01:28:33,610
And we'll go to our final question.Are you ready? Dan:Ready. Vanessa:Let's go.The final question.

1396
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:37,245
Question number 15.We've made it this far

1397
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:44,360
is about books.Something that's a love of my life. The question is Dan:And not as much mine. Vanessa:Yeah,so I'm very curious

1398
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,440
what you have to say about this.

1399
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,164
What is a book that you would recommend everyone read

1400
01:28:49,164 --> 01:28:51,198
because you loved it so much?

1401
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,200
Dan:Yeah.My answer's definitely a cop out here. Vanessa:Yeah.

1402
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,250
Dan:Because I don't read that much.

1403
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,127
And the most I ever read,we had a book club

1404
01:29:02,127 --> 01:29:04,734
and it basically required me to read.

1405
01:29:04,734 --> 01:29:07,552
And I like reading a lot.I just don't do it.

1406
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:11,431
I find myself listening to something or watching something first.

1407
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,280
So my cop out answer is some parenting book. Vanessa:Oh,okay.

1408
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:22,012
Dan:So the one that comes to my mind is called Peaceful Parenting,

1409
01:29:22,012 --> 01:29:26,202
but I don't think it specifically has to be that.

1410
01:29:26,202 --> 01:29:31,034
It just has to be something that is not too modern,

1411
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:33,872
but not just handed down generationally,

1412
01:29:33,872 --> 01:29:39,946
like,I just do what my parents did. Something intentional,training people basically

1413
01:29:39,946 --> 01:29:44,928
how to be better,kinder,gentler parents for their children.

1414
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:46,992
How to talk to them better.

1415
01:29:46,992 --> 01:29:50,840
There's a lot of strategies and tips you can get

1416
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,392
for talking about or talking to children.

1417
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,916
And the book also needs to have like a lot of

1418
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:02,373
what's that child psychology informing it scientifically

1419
01:30:02,373 --> 01:30:05,170
because the more you learn about children,

1420
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:09,952
the more you learn that they are developing at different times

1421
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:13,280
and rates and you might think they can handle something,

1422
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,193
but in reality,their brains literally can't handle it.

1423
01:30:16,193 --> 01:30:18,240
So that gives you more patience. Vanessa:Yeah.

1424
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,440
Dan:Because there's a lot of people,

1425
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,085
a lot of parents who just think their kids are stubborn

1426
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,515
or just want to yell at them for things,

1427
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,050
but they don't really get the full picture

1428
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:31,436
about the child's development and their needs. Vanessa:Yeah.Yeah.

1429
01:30:31,437 --> 01:30:35,572
Dan:So that's my answer even though it's not really one specific book. Vanessa:Don't worry.

1430
01:30:35,572 --> 01:30:38,336
Dan:I have other books that I really enjoyed,

1431
01:30:38,336 --> 01:30:40,771
but maybe aren't as relevant to people.

1432
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:45,644
One that came to my mind is called Educated. Vanessa:Oh,that was an interesting book. Yeah.

1433
01:30:45,644 --> 01:30:50,257
Dan:But that feels really relevant to me because I was homeschooled.

1434
01:30:50,257 --> 01:30:52,465
And so this girl was homeschooled,

1435
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,561
but in a really bad environment.

1436
01:30:55,561 --> 01:31:01,725
And so it's that story basically of being extremely sheltered.

1437
01:31:01,725 --> 01:31:05,416
And basically even in that terrible environment,

1438
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:07,360
there's almost pros and cons to it.

1439
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,114
It almost made her stronger in some ways, even though it was awful.

1440
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,472
Vanessa:That's an interesting story. Dan:That was a very interesting book to me.

1441
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,796
Vanessa:Yeah.I would say for the parenting books,

1442
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,510
I have an Amazon link.

1443
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:23,828
Dan:She's got a list for you.

1444
01:31:23,828 --> 01:31:28,709
Vanessa:I do.It's a Speak English With Vanessa Amazon book storefront.

1445
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:32,296
So I've chosen a bunch of books that I recommend

1446
01:31:32,296 --> 01:31:35,203
because I've made a lot of videos about books on this channel.

1447
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,092
So in the description of this video,

1448
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:41,763
you can see the Amazon link for my book recommendations and there's different folders.

1449
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,786
There's children's books,there's beginner English books.

1450
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:47,498
If you've never read a book in English before,

1451
01:31:47,498 --> 01:31:52,765
this is what I recommend reading there's intermediate books,there's nonfiction books.

1452
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:59,674
Vanessa:And in that children's book section are books for children, but also parenting book recommendations

1453
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:07,138
that have really impacted us and have been useful in our lives. For example,a book called Hunt,Gather,Parent.

1454
01:32:07,138 --> 01:32:10,783
There's another book called Peaceful Parent,Happy Kids.

1455
01:32:10,783 --> 01:32:15,923
And if you have more than one child Peaceful Parent,Happy Siblings is amazing.

1456
01:32:15,923 --> 01:32:19,120
We've read a lot of these styles of books.

1457
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,584
And I think it's just changing your mindset

1458
01:32:21,584 --> 01:32:23,600
about how to respect your child,

1459
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,369
but also still be the authority. Dan:Yeah. Vanessa:Anyway,like Dan said Dan:It's a tough balance. Vanessa:some psychology as well.

1460
01:32:28,369 --> 01:32:30,033
So there's a lot of recommendations.

1461
01:32:30,033 --> 01:32:31,740
If you click on that Amazon link

1462
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,305
and you would like to dive into the world

1463
01:32:34,305 --> 01:32:36,871
of a better relationship with your child,

1464
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,385
Dan:Especially if you got kids out there. Vanessa:Oh yeah.

1465
01:32:39,385 --> 01:32:43,461
Or you are interacting with children. Anyway,it's very insightful.

1466
01:32:43,461 --> 01:32:48,629
My recommendation was also on a similar nonfiction route.

1467
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:55,033
Because I've read a lot of fiction that's personally made me feel passionate about different topics.

1468
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,240
And I love reading fiction and diving into different worlds,

1469
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:02,640
especially historical fiction where you're learning about something in history.

1470
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,640
But I would say the book that made me

1471
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:13,437
within the last two years,the most passionate,can you guess? Dan:Something about Native Americans?

1472
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,753
Vanessa:No,I do read a lot about native Americans though.

1473
01:33:15,753 --> 01:33:19,227
Is a book called Digital Minimalism. Dan:Oh yeah.

1474
01:33:19,227 --> 01:33:24,616
I thought you were talking fiction. Vanessa:Yes. Which is Dan:Or nonfiction. Vanessa:Oh,this one is not fiction. Dan:This is nonfiction.

1475
01:33:24,616 --> 01:33:28,088
Vanessa:It's ironic because we are here sharing this on social media. Dan:Yeah.

1476
01:33:28,089 --> 01:33:34,290
Vanessa:But if you feel like you look at your phone too much,

1477
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:42,914
or if you feel like,Why did it seem like life was so much more simple in the 1990 s? Dan:It was.

1478
01:33:42,914 --> 01:33:46,839
Vanessa:This is a wonderful book to read,Digital Minimalism.

1479
01:33:46,839 --> 01:33:51,693
It confirmed everything that I suspected or that I thought about,

1480
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:56,044
especially about phones,but about media in general. Dan:Technology.

1481
01:33:56,045 --> 01:33:59,485
Vanessa:But it gave a better plan for what to do

1482
01:33:59,485 --> 01:34:05,278
because you can't just cut out YouTube from your life. I need Dan:I don't know about that.

1483
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,392
Vanessa:You can't cut out Vanessa's videos.

1484
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:10,191
When I need to,for example,do something with the garden,

1485
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:14,429
what do I do when I don't know? I Google it. I watch a YouTube video.

1486
01:34:14,429 --> 01:34:16,015
It's very useful in many ways,

1487
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:18,394
say for education or even for entertainment,

1488
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,069
but this book helps you to have a good plan

1489
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:25,823
so that you are the one in control of your media use.

1490
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,929
It's not just social media.

1491
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:30,413
It could be watching the news all the time.

1492
01:34:30,413 --> 01:34:34,143
It could be listening to podcasts all the time, whatever it is.

1493
01:34:34,143 --> 01:34:38,037
I feel like this book helped me to create a better plan for myself

1494
01:34:38,037 --> 01:34:40,030
so that I felt more in control.

1495
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:42,273
So I highly recommend this book

1496
01:34:42,273 --> 01:34:46,018
because I feel like it's ubiquitous that everyone,

1497
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:51,089
especially if you're watching this on YouTube in some way Dan:Struggles.

1498
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:55,559
Vanessa:uses technology more than they would like. Dan:Yeah.

1499
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,161
Vanessa:And technology's not a bad thing. Dan:It's a modern problem. Vanessa:Yeah.

1500
01:34:58,161 --> 01:35:01,841
It's just something that can easily get out of hand, which is a great expression.

1501
01:35:01,841 --> 01:35:07,397
Dan:So do you have any fiction books though? Vanessa:Oh yes. But that is Dan:Recommendations? Vanessa:a whole nother rabbit hole. Dan:Yeah.

1502
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:10,962
Vanessa:I would recommend if you want to read Dan:We didn't mention fiction. Vanessa:Yeah.

1503
01:35:10,962 --> 01:35:12,174
Dan:You got to say one thing at least.

1504
01:35:12,174 --> 01:35:17,114
Vanessa:Well,I do recommend watching my videos about fiction book recommendations.

1505
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,615
Dan:She's got a whole video about it right here. Vanessa:I have four videos. Dan:Or is it here?

1506
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:24,054
Vanessa:Three videos I think so far about book recommendations.

1507
01:35:24,054 --> 01:35:29,408
If you would like to watch my video about books to learn about America.

1508
01:35:29,408 --> 01:35:32,972
So they're American books about American culture

1509
01:35:32,972 --> 01:35:36,170
or they're books that are popular about the US.

1510
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:40,651
There's books I mentioned about beginner English books.

1511
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:42,579
If you've never read a book in English before

1512
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:43,914
I made a video about those.

1513
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:48,753
Nonfiction books,I think I did an advanced book video as well. There are a lot.

1514
01:35:48,753 --> 01:35:51,016
So I will put those links in the description.

1515
01:35:51,016 --> 01:35:55,072
Please dive into that if you're interested in reading. It's something I'm passionate about,

1516
01:35:55,072 --> 01:35:57,191
so I'm always happy to share more about it.

1517
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,843
And I'm glad this last question was something that is so exciting for me. Yes.

1518
01:36:02,843 --> 01:36:11,067
Well,thank you so much everyone for joining us today for this very,very long conversation. Dan:Yes. We hope you enjoyed it. Vanessa:Yes.

1520
01:36:12,377 --> 01:36:14,997

and if all goes well,next week I will be making a video

1528

1529
01:36:47,064 --> 01:36:50,749

to dive into the vocabulary a little deeper. Well,thanks Dan. Dan:You're welcome.

1533
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:10,430
Vanessa:This has been a journey this morning. Dan:Many questions. Vanessa:Many questions. Dan:Many answers.

1534
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:14,459
Did we solve the meaning of life? Vanessa:Oh,that's a good question. Let us know.

1535
01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:16,114
Do you think we solved the meaning of life?

1536
01:37:16,114 --> 01:37:17,132
What is the meaning of life?

1537
01:37:17,146 --> 01:37:19,038
Dan:I think we did as best we could.

1538
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,120
Vanessa:If you made it to the end of this video,

1539
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,448
I would like to give you a little Dan:High five.

1540
01:37:24,448 --> 01:37:29,466
Vanessa:A high five,and also a little surprise. Dan:Oh.

1541
01:37:29,466 --> 01:37:34,388
Vanessa:If you made it to the end of this video in the comments, I want you to write

1542
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,569
blue water bottle. And when I see that in the comments,

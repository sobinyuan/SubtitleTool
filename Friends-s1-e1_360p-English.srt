1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,799
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,079
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,479
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,159
So does he have a hump,
a hump and a hair piece?

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,159
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,439
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl.

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,560
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,359
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,040
Sounds like a date to me.

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,519
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria,

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,920
and I realize I'm totally naked.

12
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,799
-Yeah.
-I've had that dream.

13
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,719
Then I look down
and I realize there is a phone

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,159
there.

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,879
-Instead of...
-That's right!

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,680
-That one, I've never had.
-No.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,319
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

18
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,519
And it turns out it's my mother.

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,319
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,959
Hi.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,959
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

22
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
Are you okay, sweetie?

23
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,120
I feel like someone grabbed
my small intestine,

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,719
pulled it out of my mouth,
and tied it around my neck.

25
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,000
Cookie?

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,759
Carol moved her stuff out today.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,439
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,360
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,639
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

31
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,919
-No, you don't.
-No, I don't.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
To hell with her. She left me!

33
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,560
And you never knew
she was a lesbian.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,719
No! Okay?

35
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,360
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,599
She didn't know.
How should I know?

37
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,919
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

38
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,400
Did I say that out loud?

39
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,319
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,479
You're angry. You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is?

41
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,439
Strip joints!

42
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,080
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

43
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,919
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,319
I just wanna be married again.

45
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,879
And I just want a million dollars!

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Rachel?

47
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,439
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
I went to your building

49
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,719
and this guy with a big hammer said
that you might be here, and you are.

50
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,319
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,879
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,080
This is everybody. This is
Chandler and Phoebe, and Joey.

53
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,800
And remember my brother,
Ross?

54
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,039
-Sure!
-Hey.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,879
-Hi.
-Oh, God.

56
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,800
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,919
Oh, God! It started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
I was in this room
with all the presents,

59
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,319
and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,759
This really gorgeous Limoges
gravy boat.

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,480
I realized I was more turned on
by this gravy boat than by Barry.

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,879
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

64
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,839
How much Barry
looks like Mr. Potato Head.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

66
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,360
Anyway, I just had to get out
of there, and I started wondering:

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,240
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

68
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,160
Anyway, I just didn't know
where to go,

69
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,199
and I know
you and I have drifted apart,

70
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,639
but you're the only person
I know in the city.

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,519
Who wasn't invited
to the wedding.

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,279
I was kind of hoping
that wouldn't be an issue.

73
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,199
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ,

74
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,800
and she's really not happy
about it.

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,079
Daddy, I just...
I can't marry him. I'm sorry.

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
I just don't love him.

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,519
It matters to me.

78
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,279
She should not be wearing
those pants.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,920
-I say push her down the stairs.
-Push her down the stairs!

80
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,800
Come on, Daddy,
listen to me!

81
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:48,480
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,759
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

83
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,800
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know? Or a hat?"

84
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,319
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat. It's a metaphor, Daddy!

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
You can see
where he'd have trouble.

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,639
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,279
Maybe I'll just stay here
with Monica.

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Maybe that's my decision.

90
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,120
Maybe I don't need your money.

91
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,279
Wait! I said maybe!

92
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,639
Okay. Just breathe, that's it. Just
try to think of nice, calm things.

93
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,519
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

94
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,879
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,480
La la la something
With string

96
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,639
I'm all better now.

97
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,800
I helped.

98
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,120
Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

99
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,079
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

100
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,399
And if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

101
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,879
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

102
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

103
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,759
What?
Like there's a rule or something?

104
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,000
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

105
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,319
-It's Paul.
-Buzz him in.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,920
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

107
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,399
Maybe.

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,560
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

109
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,439
-He finally asked you out?
-Yes.

110
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,160
This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,199
-Rach, wait, I can cancel.
-Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

112
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,759
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

113
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,639
That'd be good.

114
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,600
-Really?
-No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
Hi, come in. Paul, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

116
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,519
Paul, the wine guy.

117
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,839
-Wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name.

118
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
Paul, was it?

119
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,040
-Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
-Okay.

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

121
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,240
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

122
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,839
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon,

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
so, nothing.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,039
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

125
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,320
God. No. Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

126
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,519
Talk about your...

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
big lizards.

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight,

129
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,200
Joey and Chandler
are helping me with my furniture.

130
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,399
Yes, and we're very excited
about it.

131
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,960
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

132
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,320
-It's been a long day.
-Sure. Okay. Sure.

133
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,440
-Pheebs, you wanna help?
-I wish I could, but I don't want to.

134
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things

135
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,399
using a bunch
of these little worm guys.

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,240
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever,

137
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,200
and I cannot feel my legs.

138
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,799
-What's this?
-I have no idea.

139
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,919
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,399
This was Carol's favorite beer.

141
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,799
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

142
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,360
Hey. Ross,
let me ask you a question.

143
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,519
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

144
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,639
-What did you get?
-You guys.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,840
-Oh, God.
-You got screwed.

146
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,840
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

147
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,679
I should've caught on

148
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,080
when she went to the dentist
four and five times a week.

149
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,360
How clean can teeth get?

150
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,840
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

151
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,639
How did you get through it?

152
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,159
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

153
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
-Say her...
-Leg?

154
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,679
That's one way
of going through it, yeah.

155
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,679
Me, I went for the watch.

156
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,919
You actually broke her watch?

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

158
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,679
You probably think it's about
making love with your socks on,

159
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,759
but it isn't.

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,320
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

161
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,000
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

162
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,240
You know what's scary?

163
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,840
What if there's only one woman
for everybody?

164
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,200
What if you get one woman,
and that's it?

165
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,600
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

166
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
What are you talking about?
One woman.

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,639
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

168
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,919
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
There's Rocky Road and Cookie Dough
and Bing Cherry Vanilla.

170
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,600
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

171
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,559
This is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

172
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,320
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

173
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,200
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon.

174
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,639
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

175
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,639
Then stay out of my freezer.

176
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,559
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

177
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,639
What?

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,679
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

179
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,039
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

180
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,720
So there's gonna be a fifth date?

181
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,000
Isn't there?

182
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeah. I think there is.

183
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,879
What were you gonna say?

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,080
Well...

185
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,320
Ever since she left me,

186
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,360
I haven't been able
to perform sexually.

187
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, God! I am so...

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,799
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

189
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,000
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

190
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
How long?

191
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
Two years.

192
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

193
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,480
So you still think
you might want that fifth date?

194
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,519
Yeah.

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,559
Yeah, I do.

196
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,919
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

197
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,519
-Do you take Joanie...
-See.

198
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,519
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
"Grab a spoon."

200
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,039
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

201
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,240
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Here's the thing.

203
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,120
Even if I could get it together
enough to ask a woman out

204
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
who am I gonna ask?

205
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Isn't this amazing?

206
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,399
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,000
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

208
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
While you're on a roll,

209
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,519
if you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something...

210
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,639
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

211
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,960
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

212
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,519
-Morning.
-Morning.

213
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,639
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,720
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

215
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,480
I had a really great time last night.

216
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,279
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

217
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,919
-We'll talk later, okay?
-Yeah.

218
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,360
Thank you.

219
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,159
That wasn't a real date.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,639
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

221
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,879
-Shut up and put my table back.
-Okay.

222
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,960
All right, kids,
I gotta get to work.

223
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,360
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

224
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

225
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,840
Yeah, we all have jobs.
See, that's how we buy stuff.

226
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,600
-Yeah, I'm an actor.
-Would I have seen you in anything?

227
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,039
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

228
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

229
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,159
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

230
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,600
-I will not take this abuse.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

231
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,600
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

232
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,960
So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

233
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,159
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,639
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

235
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,039
I know. He's just so...

236
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
Remember you
and Tony De Marco?

237
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,559
-Yeah.
-It's like that. With feelings.

238
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
Are you in trouble!

239
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,559
Okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work,

240
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,399
and not think about him all day.

241
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,799
Or else I'm just gonna get up
and go to work.

242
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,080
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

243
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

244
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,559
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

245
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,559
-How was Florida?
-You had sex, didn't you?

246
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,840
How do you do that?

247
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,960
-So, who?
-You know Paul?

248
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,159
Paul, the wine guy?

249
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,679
Yeah, I know Paul.

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,720
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

251
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,080
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

252
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,039
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

253
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,600
Of course it was a line.

254
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,759
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

255
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,039
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

256
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,879
"To get you into bed."

257
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,559
Is it me?

258
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,119
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs,

259
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,839
and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

260
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,680
All right, come here.
Give me your feet.

261
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I just thought he was nice,
you know?

262
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

263
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,599
Guess what.

264
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,480
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

265
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,079
I'm trained for nothing.

266
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,960
I was laughed out
of 12 interviews today.

267
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,640
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

268
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
You would be too

269
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
if you found Joan and David boots
on sale 50 percent off.

270
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,759
How well you know me.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,039
They're my new
"I don't need a job or my parents.

272
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,000
I've got great boots" boots.

273
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
-How'd you pay for them?
-Credit card.

274
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,559
And who pays for that?

275
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,200
My father.

276
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,759
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

277
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,400
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

278
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,880
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

279
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,480
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

280
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,240
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

281
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,160
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

282
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,279
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

283
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,279
I ended up living with
this albino guy

284
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,079
who was cleaning windshields
outside Port Authority.

285
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,079
And then he killed himself.

286
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,759
And then I found aromatherapy.

287
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,119
So believe me,
I know exactly how you feel.

288
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,319
The word you're looking for is:

289
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,119
"Anyway..."

290
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,319
All right. You ready?

291
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,960
-I don't think so.
-Come on.

292
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,680
-Cut.
-Cut.

293
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,559
-Hey.
-All right.

294
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:59,799
Welcome to the real world.
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

295
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,799
That's it.
You gonna crash on the couch?

296
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,160
-No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

297
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,599
Yeah.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,400
Look what I just found on the floor.

299
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
-What?
-That's Paul's watch.

300
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,440
You can just put it back
where you found it.

301
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, boy. All right.
Good night, everybody.

302
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,039
Good night.

303
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,079
-Sorry.
-No. Go.

304
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,119
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

305
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,319
-Okay.
-Okay.

306
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,240
Thanks.

307
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
You probably didn't know this,

308
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,720
but back in high school I had
a major crush on you.

309
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
I knew.

310
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,079
You did?

311
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,599
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

312
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,599
I did.

313
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,599
Listen, do you think...

314
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,960
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

315
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,680
Do you think it would be okay
if I ask you out sometime, maybe?

316
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,640
Yeah.

317
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,319
Maybe.

318
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,039
Okay.

319
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,960
Okay, maybe I will.

320
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,799
-Good night.
-Good night.

321
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
See you.

322
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,400
Wait. What's with you?

323
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,160
I just grabbed a spoon.

324
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,400
Can't believe what I'm hearing.

325
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
I can't believe
What I'm hearing here

326
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,519
-What? I said you had...
-What? I said you had...

327
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,200
-Would you stop?
-Was I doing it again?

328
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,400
Yes.

329
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,759
Would anybody like more coffee?

330
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,079
Did you make it
or are you just serving it?

331
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,240
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

332
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,839
Kids, new dream.
I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.

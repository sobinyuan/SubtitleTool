1
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,878
thinking back to it,because my memory of it is it was like a plywood deck hanging from the ceiling.

2
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,742
Vanessa:Did it have a Dan:It was hanging down,and you climbed a ladder up to it.

3
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:55,363
It had plywood walls,but there were gaps in the walls too,where you could just jump down,which we didn't jump down.

4
01:04:55,363 --> 01:04:59,506
But what we did was because it was a one room cabin,if my parents

5
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,389
were there with some friends or my grandparents,they would play cards,and they would send us to

6
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,105
bed,but we could hear everything,so we'd spy on them and we'd drop stuff down on them and stuff.

7
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,037
Vanessa:That sounds fun. Dan:Yeah.That was fun.

8
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:16,055
Vanessa:Wow,so maybe we can recreate this rustic experience. Dan:We need a loft.

9
01:05:16,055 --> 01:05:20,549
Vanessa:Do you think it would be just as fun as an adult?Because you were a kid doing it,

10
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,068
do you think that Dan:To sleep in the loft?

11
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:29,020
Vanessa:Well,for us,because we're adults now,so having this rural experience,would it be as fun for us as it would

12
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,468
Dan:I think it would be. Vanessa:as for kids?

13
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:34,240
Dan:Yeah,because one benefit of being in a place like

14
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:42,136
America and the United States is that you can usually find some place that is very rural and quiet.

15
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:44,704
Vanessa:Quickly and close. Dan:We live close

16
01:05:44,704 --> 01:05:50,053
enough to a highway and stuff that it would be nice to just only hear the birds chirping.

17
01:05:50,053 --> 01:05:52,418
Vanessa:Yeah.I think that's really possible.I mean

18
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:57,994
Dan:And get away from electronics and stuff.It would have to be an intentional,this is not a place

19
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,892
where we have a TV,for example.

20
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:06,240
Vanessa:Yeah.I think you can drive about 20 minutes away from our house and be very much in the woods. Dan:Yes.

21
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:14,134
Vanessa:But anyway,that's a specific discussion for another time. Dan:Yes. Vanessa:Cool.So,you'd like to have Dan:More property.

22
01:06:14,134 --> 01:06:18,152
Vanessa:a cabin,and that would be a investment,an investment that you could justify.

23
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,072
Well,I think for me,when I thought about this,I thought more of something that we already do

24
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,720
that we have justified spending more money on,so Dan:Garden boxes.

25
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,275
Vanessa:I spend too much money on the garden.That's true.

26
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,439
These are the world's most expensive tomatoes.

27
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:40,767
Dan:We are now a small scale farm.

28
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:48,258
Vanessa:That's not what I was saying,but that is true.I thought of something more in our daily life.

29
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:53,896
I think this is different for everyone depending on how much money you have.

30
01:06:53,896 --> 01:07:03,630
At some point in our marriage,we bought the cheapest food.This is all that we could afford and that was it.

31
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:12,560
But then as we made more money,we wanted to intentionally buy better quality food. Dan:We prioritize it.

32
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:20,789
Vanessa:Yeah.So,instead of just buying expensive food,we wanted to buy,especially we kind of made an intention to buy

33
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,545
better quality animal products specifically.

34
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:28,073
In the US,you have a lot of options.You could buy

35
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:35,347
organic carrots or conventional carrots,and not so much that I'm thinking more about meat

36
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:41,545
and yogurt and cheese and milk Dan:Where the creatures are involved.

37
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:46,240
Vanessa:Yeah,because in the area where we live,there's a lot of options for buying

38
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:53,429
local grass fed beef,for example,where there's a farm down the street and it's

39
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,602
much more expensive than buying the cheapest beef at the grocery store.

40
01:07:59,602 --> 01:08:06,395
But for us,as we've made more money,this has been something that we justify spending more money on.

41
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:14,309
If we didn't have money,then I would not spend money on that,because that wasn't a priority.

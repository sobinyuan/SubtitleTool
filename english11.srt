1104
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,880
thinking back to it, because my memory of it is it 
was like a plywood deck hanging from the ceiling. 

1105
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,533
Vanessa:
Did it have a- 

1106
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:47,280
Dan:
It was hanging down, and you climbed a ladder up  

1107
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,520
to it. It had plywood walls, but there were gaps 
in the walls too, where you could just jump down,  

1108
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:59,520
which we didn't jump down. But what we did was 
because it was a one room cabin, if my parents  

1109
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,400
were there with some friends or my grandparents, 
they would play cards, and they would send us to  

1110
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,120
bed, but we could hear everything, so we'd spy on 
them and we'd drop stuff down on them and stuff. 

1111
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,920
Vanessa:
That sounds fun. 

1112
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,040
Dan:
Yeah. That was fun. 

1113
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,760
Vanessa:
Wow, so maybe we can recreate this  

1114
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,000
rustic experience.
Dan: 

1115
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,080
We need a loft.
Vanessa: 

1116
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,560
Do you think it would be just as fun as 
an adult? Because you were a kid doing it,  

1117
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,200
do you think that-
Dan: 

1118
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,320
To sleep in the loft?
Vanessa: 

1119
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:28,320
Well, for us, because we're adults now, so 
having this rural experience, would it be as  

1120
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,120
fun for us as it would-
Dan: 

1121
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,787
I think it would be.
Vanessa: 

1122
01:05:29,787 --> 01:05:30,640
... as for kids?
Dan: 

1123
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,240
Yeah, because one benefit of being in a place like  

1124
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,720
America and the United States is that you can 
usually find some place that is very rural  

1125
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,600
and quiet.
Vanessa: 

1126
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,840
Quickly and close.
Dan: 

1127
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,160
We live close enough to a highway 
and stuff that it would be nice to  

1128
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,480
just only hear the birds chirping.
Vanessa: 

1129
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,560
Yeah. I think that's really possible. I mean-
Dan: 

1130
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,000
And get away from electronics and stuff. It would 
have to be an intentional, this is not a place  

1131
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,320
where we have a TV, for example.
Vanessa: 

1132
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,800
Yeah. I think you can drive about 20 minutes away 
from our house and be very much in the woods. 

1133
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,240
Dan:
Yes. 

1134
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,000
Vanessa:
But anyway, that's a  

1135
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,880
specific discussion for another time.
Dan: 

1136
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,560
Yes.
Vanessa: 

1137
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,680
Cool. So, you'd like to have-
Dan: 

1138
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,362
More property.
Vanessa: 

1139
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:18,160
... a cabin, and that would be a investment, 
an investment that you could justify.  

1140
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,080
Well, I think for me, when I thought about this, 
I thought more of something that we already do  

1141
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,760
that we have justified spending more money on, so-
Dan: 

1142
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,200
Garden boxes.
Vanessa: 

1143
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,280
I spend too much money on the garden. That's true.  

1144
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,624
These are the world's most expensive tomatoes.
Dan: 

1145
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:41,200
We are now a small scale farm.
Vanessa: 

1146
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,840
That's not what I was saying, but that 
is true. I thought of something more  

1147
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:54,160
in our daily life. I think this is different for 
everyone depending on how much money you have. At  

1148
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:01,920
some point in our marriage, we bought the cheapest 
food. This is all that we could afford and  

1149
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:11,240
that was it. But then as we made more money, we 
wanted to intentionally buy better quality food. 

1150
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,560
Dan:
We prioritize it. 

1151
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,760
Vanessa:
Yeah. So, instead  

1152
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:20,800
of just buying expensive food, we wanted to buy, 
especially we kind of made an intention to buy  

1153
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:28,080
better quality animal products specifically. In 
the US, you have a lot of options. You could buy  

1154
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:35,360
organic carrots or conventional carrots, and 
not so much that I'm thinking more about meat  

1155
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,080
and yogurt and cheese and milk-
Dan: 

1156
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,840
Where the creatures are involved.
Vanessa: 

1157
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,240
Yeah, because in the area where we live, 
there's a lot of options for buying  

1158
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:53,440
local grass fed beef, for example, where 
there's a farm down the street and it's  

1159
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:00,640
much more expensive than buying the cheapest 
beef at the grocery store. But for us,  

1160
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,400
as we've made more money, this has been 
something that we justify spending more money on.  

1161
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:14,320
If we didn't have money, then I would not spend 
money on that, because that wasn't a priority.
